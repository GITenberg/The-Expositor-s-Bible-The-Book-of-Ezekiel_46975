        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this volume I
        have endeavoured to present the substance of Ezekiel's prophecies in
        a form intelligible to students of the English Bible. I have tried to
        make the exposition a fairly adequate guide to the sense of the text,
        and to supply such information as seemed necessary to elucidate the
        historical importance of the prophet's teaching. Where I have
        departed from the received text I have usually indicated in a note
        the nature of the change introduced. Whilst I have sought to exercise
        an independent judgment on all the questions touched upon, the book
        has no pretensions to rank as a contribution to Old Testament
        scholarship.</p>

        Ezekiel to which I am chiefly indebted are: Ewald's <span class=

          Jewish State.</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Ezekiel is a
          prophet of the Exile. He was one of the priests who went into
          captivity with King Jehoiachin in the year 597, and the whole of
          his prophetic career falls after that event. Of his previous life
          and circumstances we have no direct information, beyond the facts
          that he was a priest and that his father's name was Buzi. One or
          two inferences, however, may be regarded as reasonably certain. We
          know that that first deportation of Judæans to Babylon was confined
          to the nobility, the men of war, and the craftsmen (2 Kings xxiv.
          14-16); and since Ezekiel was neither a soldier nor an artisan, his
          place in the train of captives must have been due to his social
          position. He must have belonged to the upper ranks of the
          priesthood, who formed part of the aristocracy of Jerusalem. He was
          thus a member of the house of Zadok; and his familiarity with the
          details of the Temple ritual makes it probable that he had actually
          officiated as a priest in the national sanctuary. Moreover, a
          careful study of the book gives the impression that he was no
          longer a young man at the time when he received his call to the
          prophetic office. He appears as one whose views of life are already
          matured, who has outlived the buoyancy and enthusiasm of youth, and
          learned to estimate the moral possibilities of life with the
          sobriety that comes through experience. This impression is
          confirmed by the fact that he was married and had a <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page004">[pg 004]</span><a name="Pg004" id="Pg004"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> house of his own from the commencement
          of his work, and probably at the time of his captivity. But the
          most important fact of all is that Ezekiel had lived through a
          period of unprecedented public calamity, and one fraught with the
          most momentous consequences for the future of religion. Moving in
          the highest circles of society, in the centre of the national life,
          he must have been fully cognisant of the grave events in which no
          thoughtful observer could fail to recognise the tokens of the
          approaching dissolution of the Hebrew state. Amongst the influences
          that prepared him for his prophetic mission, a leading place must
          therefore be assigned to the teaching of history; and we cannot
          commence our study of his prophecies better than by a brief survey
          of the course of events that led up to the turning-point of his own
          career, and at the same time helped to form his conception of God's
          providential dealings with His people Israel.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the time of
          the prophet's birth the kingdom of Judah was still a nominal
          dependency of the great Assyrian empire. From about the middle of
          the seventh century, however, the power of Nineveh had been on the
          wane. Her energies had been exhausted in the suppression of a
          determined revolt in Babylonia. Media and Egypt had recovered their
          independence, and there were many signs that a new crisis in the
          affairs of nations was at hand.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first
          historic event which has left discernible traces in the writings of
          Ezekiel is an irruption of Scythian barbarians, which took place in
          the reign of Josiah (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">c.</span></span> 626). Strangely enough, the
          historical books of the Old Testament contain no record of this
          remarkable invasion, although its effects on the political
          situation of Judah were important and far-reaching. According to
          Herodotus, Assyria was already hard pressed by the Medes, when
          suddenly the Scythians burst through the passes of the <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page005">[pg 005]</span><a name="Pg005" id="Pg005"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Caucasus, defeated the Medes, and
          committed extensive ravages throughout Western Asia for a period of
          twenty-eight years. They are said to have contemplated the invasion
          of Egypt, and to have actually reached the Philistine territory,
          when by some means they were induced to withdraw.<a id="noteref_1"
          name="noteref_1" href="#note_1"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1</span></span></a> Judah
          therefore was in imminent danger, and the terror inspired by these
          destructive hordes is reflected in the prophecies of Zephaniah and
          Jeremiah, who saw in the northern invaders the heralds of the great
          day of Jehovah. The force of the storm, however, was probably spent
          before it reached Palestine, and it seems to have swept past along
          the coast, leaving the mountain land of Israel untouched. Although
          Ezekiel was not old enough to have remembered the panic caused by
          these movements, the report of them would be one of the earliest
          memories of his childhood, and it made a lasting impression on his
          mind. One of his later prophecies, that against Gog, is coloured by
          such reminiscences, the last judgment on the heathen being
          represented under forms suggested by a Scythian invasion (chs.
          xxxviii., xxxix.). We may note also that in ch. xxxii. the names of
          Meshech and Tubal occur in the list of conquering nations who have
          already gone down to the under-world. These northern peoples formed
          the kernel of the army of Gog, and the only occasion on which they
          can be supposed to have played the part of great conquerors in the
          past is in connection with the Scythian devastations, in which they
          probably had a share.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The withdrawal
          of the Scythians from the neighbourhood of Palestine was followed
          by the great reformation which made the eighteenth year of Josiah
          an epoch in the history of Israel. The conscience of the nation had
          been quickened by its escape from so great a peril, and the time
          was favourable <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page006">[pg
          006]</span><a name="Pg006" id="Pg006" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          for carrying out the changes which were necessary in order to bring
          the religious practice of the country into conformity with the
          requirements of the Law. The outstanding feature of the movement
          was the discovery of the book of Deuteronomy in the Temple, and the
          ratification of a solemn league and covenant, by which the king,
          princes, and people pledged themselves to carry out its demands.
          This took place in the year 621, somewhere near the time of
          Ezekiel's birth.<a id="noteref_2" name="noteref_2" href=
          "#note_2"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2</span></span></a> The
          prophet's youth was therefore spent in the wake of the reformation;
          and although the first hopes cherished by its promoters may have
          died away before he was able to appreciate its tendencies, we may
          be sure that he received from it impulses which continued with him
          to the end of his life. We may perhaps allow ourselves to
          conjecture that his father belonged to that section of the
          priesthood which, under Hilkiah its head, co-operated with the king
          in the task of reform, and desired to see a pure worship
          established in the Temple. If so, we can readily understand how the
          reforming spirit passed into the very fibre of Ezekiel's mind. To
          how great an extent his thinking was influenced by the ideas of
          Deuteronomy appears from almost every page of his prophecies.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was yet
          another way in which the Scythian invasion influenced the prospects
          of the Hebrew kingdom. Although the Scythians appear to have
          rendered an immediate service to Assyria by saving Nineveh from the
          first attack of the Medes, there is little doubt that their ravages
          throughout the northern and western parts of the empire prepared
          the way for its ultimate collapse, and weakened its hold on the
          outlying provinces. Accordingly we find <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page007">[pg 007]</span><a name="Pg007" id="Pg007" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> that Josiah, in pursuance of his scheme of
          reformation, exercised a freedom of action beyond the boundaries of
          his own land which would not have been tolerated if Assyria had
          retained her old vigour. Patriotic visions of an independent Hebrew
          monarchy seem to have combined with new-born zeal for a pure
          national religion to make the latter part of Josiah's reign the
          short <span class="tei tei-q">“Indian summer”</span> of Israel's
          national existence.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The period of
          partial independence was brought to an end about 607 by the fall of
          Nineveh before the united forces of the Medes and the Babylonians.
          In itself this event was of less consequence to the history of
          Judah than might be supposed. The Assyrian empire vanished from the
          earth with a completeness which is one of the surprises of history;
          but its place was taken by the new Babylonian empire, which
          inherited its policy, its administration, and the best part of its
          provinces. The seat of empire was transferred from Nineveh to
          Babylon; but any other change which was felt at Jerusalem was due
          solely to the exceptional vigour and ability of its first monarch,
          Nebuchadnezzar.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The real
          turning-point in the destinies of Israel came a year or two earlier
          with the defeat and death of Josiah at Megiddo. About the year 608,
          while the fate of Nineveh still hung in the balance, Pharaoh Necho
          prepared an expedition to the Euphrates, with the object of
          securing himself in the possession of Syria. It was assuredly no
          feeling of loyalty to his Assyrian suzerain which prompted Josiah
          to throw himself across Necho's path. He acted as an independent
          monarch, and his motives were no doubt the loftiest that ever urged
          a king to a dangerous, not to say foolhardy, enterprise. The zeal
          with which the crusade against idolatry and false worship had been
          prosecuted seems to have begotten a confidence on the part of the
          king's advisers that the hand of Jehovah was <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page008">[pg 008]</span><a name="Pg008" id="Pg008"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> with them, and that His help might be
          reckoned on in any undertaking entered upon in His name. One would
          like to know what the prophet Jeremiah said about the venture; but
          probably the defence of Jehovah's land seemed so obvious a duty of
          the Davidic king that he was not even consulted. It was the
          determination to maintain the inviolability of the land which was
          Jehovah's sanctuary that encouraged Josiah in defiance of every
          prudential consideration to endeavour by force to intercept the
          passage of the Egyptian army. The disaster that followed gave the
          death-blow to this illusion and the shallow optimism which sprang
          from it. There was an end of idealism in politics; and the ruling
          class in Jerusalem fell back on the old policy of vacillation
          between Egypt and her eastern rival which had always been the snare
          of Jewish statesmanship. And with Josiah's political ideal the
          faith on which it was based also gave way. It seemed that the
          experiment of exclusive reliance on Jehovah as the guardian of the
          nation's interests had been tried and had failed, and so the death
          of the last good king of Judah was a signal for a great outburst of
          idolatry, in which every divine power was invoked and every form of
          worship sedulously practised in order to sustain the courage of men
          who were resolved to fight to the death for their national
          existence.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By the time of
          Josiah's death Ezekiel was able to take an intelligent interest in
          public affairs. He lived through the troubled period that ensued in
          the full consciousness of its disastrous import for the fortunes of
          his people, and occasional references to it are to be found in his
          writings. He remembers and commiserates the sad fate of Jehoahaz,
          the king of the people's choice, who was dethroned and imprisoned
          by Pharaoh Necho during the short interval of Egyptian supremacy.
          The next king, Jehoiakim, received the throne as a vassal of Egypt,
          on the condition of paying <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page009">[pg 009]</span><a name="Pg009" id="Pg009" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> a heavy annual tribute. After the battle of
          Carchemish, in which Necho was defeated by Nebuchadnezzar and
          driven out of Syria, Jehoiakim transferred his allegiance to the
          Babylonian monarch; but after three years' service he revolted,
          encouraged no doubt by the usual promises of support from Egypt.
          The incursions of marauding bands of Chaldæans, Syrians, Moabites,
          and Ammonites, instigated doubtless from Babylon, kept him in play
          until Nebuchadnezzar was free to devote his attention to the
          western part of his empire. Before that time arrived, however,
          Jehoiakim had died, and was followed by his son Jehoiachin. This
          prince was hardly seated on the throne, when a Babylonian army,
          with Nebuchadnezzar at its head, appeared before the gates of
          Jerusalem. The siege ended in a capitulation, and the king, the
          queen-mother, the army and nobility, a section of the priests and
          the prophets, and all the skilled artisans were transported to
          Babylonia (597).</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With this event
          the history of Ezekiel may be said to begin. But in order to
          understand the conditions under which his ministry was exercised,
          we must try to realise the situation created by this first removal
          of Judæan captives. From this time to the final capture of
          Jerusalem, a period of eleven years, the national life was broken
          into two streams, which ran in parallel channels, one in Judah and
          the other in Babylon. The object of the captivity was of course to
          deprive the nation of its natural leaders, its head and its hands,
          and leave it incapable of organised resistance to the Chaldæans. In
          this respect Nebuchadnezzar simply adopted the traditional policy
          of the later Assyrian kings, only he applied it with much less
          rigour than they were accustomed to display. Instead of making
          nearly a clean sweep of the conquered population, and filling the
          gap by colonists from a distant part of his empire, as had been
          done in the case of Samaria, he <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page010">[pg 010]</span><a name="Pg010" id="Pg010" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> contented himself with removing the more
          dangerous elements of the state, and making a native prince
          responsible for the government of the country. The result showed
          how greatly he had underrated the fierce and fanatical
          determination which was already a part of the Jewish character.
          Nothing in the whole story is more wonderful than the rapidity with
          which the enfeebled remnant in Jerusalem recovered their military
          efficiency, and prepared a more resolute defence than the unbroken
          nation had been able to offer.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The exiles, on
          the other hand, succeeded in preserving most of their national
          peculiarities under the very eyes of their conquerors. Of their
          temporal condition very little is known beyond the fact that they
          found themselves in tolerably easy circumstances, with the
          opportunity to acquire property and amass wealth. The advice which
          Jeremiah sent them from Jerusalem, that they should identify
          themselves with the interests of Babylon, and live settled and
          orderly lives in peaceful industry and domestic happiness (Jer.
          xxix. 5-7), shows that they were not treated as prisoners or as
          slaves. They appear to have been distributed in villages in the
          fertile territory of Babylon, and to have formed themselves into
          separate communities under the elders, who were the natural
          authorities in a simple Semitic society. The colony in which
          Ezekiel lived was located in Tel Abib, near the <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Nahr</span></span>
          (river or canal) Kebar, but neither the river nor the settlement
          can now be identified. The Kebar, if not the name of an arm of the
          Euphrates itself, was probably one of the numerous irrigating
          canals which intersected in all parts the great alluvial plain of
          the Euphrates and Tigris.<a id="noteref_3" name="noteref_3" href=
          "#note_3"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3</span></span></a>
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page011">[pg 011]</span><a name=
          "Pg011" id="Pg011" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> In this settlement
          the prophet had his own house, where the people were free to visit
          him, and social life in all probability differed little from that
          in a small provincial town in Palestine. That, to be sure, was a
          great change for the quondam aristocrats of Jerusalem, but it was
          not a change to which they could not readily adapt themselves.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of much greater
          importance, however, is the state of mind which prevailed amongst
          these exiles. And here again the remarkable thing is their intense
          preoccupation with matters national and Israelitic. A lively
          intercourse with the mother country was kept up, and the exiles
          were perfectly informed of all that was going on in Jerusalem.
          There were, no doubt, personal and selfish reasons for their keen
          interest in the doings of their countrymen at home. The antipathy
          which existed between the two branches of the Jewish people was
          extreme. The exiles had left their children behind them (Ezek.
          xxiv. 21, 25) to suffer under the reproach of their fathers'
          misfortunes. They appear also to have been compelled to sell their
          estates hurriedly on the eve of their departure, and such
          transactions, necessarily turning to the advantage of the
          purchasers, left a deep grudge in the breasts of the sellers. Those
          who remained in the land exulted in the calamity which had brought
          so much profit to themselves, and thought themselves perfectly
          secure in so doing because they regarded their brethren as men
          driven out for their sins from Jehovah's heritage. The exiles on
          their part affected the utmost contempt for the pretensions of the
          upstart plebeians who were carrying things with a high hand in
          Jerusalem. Like the French <span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign"
          xml:lang="fr"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Émigrés</span></span> in the time of the
          Revolution, they no doubt felt that their country was being ruined
          for want of proper guidance and experienced statesmanship. Nor was
          it altogether patrician prejudice that gave them this feeling of
          their own superiority. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page012">[pg
          012]</span><a name="Pg012" id="Pg012" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          Both Jeremiah and Ezekiel regard the exiles as the better part of
          the nation, and the nucleus of the Messianic community of the
          future. For the present, indeed, there does not seem to have been
          much to choose, in point of religious belief and practice, between
          the two sections of the people. In both places the majority were
          steeped in idolatrous and superstitious notions; some appear even
          to have entertained the purpose of assimilating themselves to the
          heathen around, and only a small minority were steadfast in their
          allegiance to the national religion. Yet the exiles could not, any
          more than the remnant in Judah, abandon the hope that Jehovah would
          save His sanctuary from desecration. The Temple was <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the excellency of their strength, the desire of their
          eyes, and that which their soul pitied”</span> (Ezek. xxiv. 21).
          False prophets appeared in Babylon to prophesy smooth things, and
          assure the exiles of a speedy restoration to their place in the
          people of God. It was not till Jerusalem was laid in ruins, and the
          Jewish state had disappeared from the earth, that the Israelites
          were in a mood to understand the meaning of God's judgment, or to
          learn the lessons which the prophecy of nearly two centuries had
          vainly striven to inculcate.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have now
          reached the point at which the Book of Ezekiel opens, and what
          remains to be told of the history of the time will be given in
          connection with the prophecies on which it is fitted to throw
          light. But before proceeding to consider his entrance on the
          prophetic office, it will be useful to dwell for a little on what
          was probably the most fruitful influence of Ezekiel's youth, the
          personal influence of his contemporary and predecessor Jeremiah.
          This will form the subject of the next chapter.</p>

          <span style="font-size: 144%">Chapter II. Jeremiah And
          Ezekiel.</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Each of the
          communities described in the last chapter was the theatre of the
          activity of a great prophet. When Ezekiel began to prophesy at Tel
          Abib, Jeremiah was approaching the end of his great and tragic
          career. For five-and-thirty years he had been known as a prophet,
          and during the latter part of that time had been the most prominent
          figure in Jerusalem. For the next five years their ministries were
          contemporaneous, and it is somewhat remarkable that they ignore
          each other in their writings so completely as they do. We would
          give a good deal to have some reference by Ezekiel to Jeremiah or
          by Jeremiah to Ezekiel, but we find none. Scripture does not often
          favour us with those cross-lights which prove so instructive in the
          hands of a modern historian. While Jeremiah knows of the rise of
          false prophets in Babylonia, and Ezekiel denounces those he had
          left behind in Jerusalem, neither of these great men betrays the
          slightest consciousness of the existence of the other. This silence
          is specially noticeable on Ezekiel's part, because his frequent
          descriptions of the state of society in Jerusalem give him abundant
          opportunity to express his sympathy with the position of Jeremiah.
          When we read in the twenty-second chapter that there was not found
          a man to make up the fence and stand in the breach before God, we
          might be tempted to conclude that he really was not aware of
          Jeremiah's noble stand for righteousness in the <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page014">[pg 014]</span><a name="Pg014" id="Pg014"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> corrupt and doomed city. And yet the
          points of contact between the two prophets are so numerous and so
          obvious that they cannot fairly be explained by the common
          operation of the Spirit of God on the minds of both. There is
          nothing in the nature of prophecy to forbid the view that one
          prophet learned from another, and built on the foundation which his
          predecessors had laid; and when we find a parallelism so close as
          that between Jeremiah and Ezekiel we are driven to the conclusion
          that the influence was unusually direct, and that the whole
          thinking of the younger writer had been moulded by the teaching and
          example of the older.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In what way this
          influence was communicated is a question on which some difference
          of opinion may exist. Some writers, such as Kuenen, think that the
          indebtedness of Ezekiel to Jeremiah was mainly literary. That is to
          say, they hold that it must be accounted for by prolonged study on
          Ezekiel's part of the written prophecies of him who was his
          teacher. Kuenen surmises that this happened after the destruction
          of Jerusalem, when some friends of Jeremiah arrived in Babylon,
          bringing with them the completed volume of his prophecies. Before
          Ezekiel proceeded to write his own prophecies, his mind is supposed
          to have been so saturated with the ideas and language of Jeremiah
          that every part of his book bears the impress and betrays the
          influence of his predecessor. In this fact, of course, Kuenen finds
          an argument for the view that Ezekiel's prophecies were written at
          a comparatively late period of his life. It is difficult to speak
          with confidence on some of the points raised by this hypothesis.
          That the influence of Jeremiah can be traced in all parts of the
          book of Ezekiel is undoubtedly true; but it is not so clear that it
          can be assigned equally to all periods of Jeremiah's activity. Many
          of the prophecies of Jeremiah cannot be referred to a definite
          date; and we do not know what <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page015">[pg 015]</span><a name="Pg015" id="Pg015" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> means Ezekiel had of obtaining copies of
          those which belong to the period after the two prophets were
          separated. We know, however, that a great part of the book of
          Jeremiah was in writing several years before Ezekiel was carried
          away to Babylon; and we may safely assume that amongst the
          treasures which he took with him into exile was the roll written by
          Baruch to the dictation of Jeremiah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim
          (Jer. xxxvi.). Even later oracles may have reached Ezekiel either
          before or during his prophetic career through the active
          correspondence maintained between the exiles and Jerusalem. It is
          possible, therefore, that even the literary dependence of Ezekiel
          on Jeremiah may belong to a much earlier time than the final issue
          of the book of Ezekiel; and if it should be found that ideas in the
          earlier part of the book suggest acquaintance with a later
          utterance of Jeremiah, the fact need not surprise us. It is
          certainly no sufficient reason for concluding that the whole
          substance of Ezekiel's prophecy had been recast under the influence
          of a late perusal of the work of Jeremiah.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But, setting
          aside verbal coincidences and other phenomena which suggest
          literary dependence, there remains an affinity of a much deeper
          kind between the teaching of the two prophets, which can only be
          explained, if it is to be explained at all, by the personal
          influence of the older upon the younger. And it is these more
          fundamental resemblances which are of most interest for our present
          purpose, because they may enable us to understand something of the
          settled convictions with which Ezekiel entered on the prophet's
          calling. Moreover, a comparison of the two prophets will bring out
          more clearly than anything else certain aspects of the character of
          Ezekiel which it is important to bear in mind. Both are men of
          strongly marked individuality, and no conception <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page016">[pg 016]</span><a name="Pg016" id="Pg016"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of the age in which they lived can
          safely be formed from the writings of either, taken alone.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It has been
          already remarked that Jeremiah was the most conspicuous public
          character of his day. If it be the case that he threw his spell
          over the youthful mind of Ezekiel, the fact is the most striking
          tribute to his influence that could be conceived. No two men could
          differ more widely in natural temperament and character. Jeremiah
          is the prophet of a dying nation, and the agony of Judah's
          prolonged death-struggle is reproduced with tenfold intensity in
          the inward conflict which rends the heart of the prophet.
          Inexorable in his prediction of the coming doom, he confesses that
          this is because he is over-mastered by the Divine power which urges
          him into a path from which his nature recoiled. He deplores the
          isolation which is forced upon him, the alienation of friends and
          kinsmen, and the constant strife of which he is the reluctant
          cause. He feels as if he could gladly shake off the burden of
          prophetic responsibility and become a man amongst common men. His
          human sympathies go forth towards his unhappy country, and his
          heart bleeds for the misery which he sees hanging over the
          misguided people, for whom he is forbidden even to pray. The tragic
          conflict of his life reaches its height in those expostulations
          with Jehovah which are amongst the most remarkable passages of the
          Old Testament. They express the shrinking of a sensitive nature
          from the inward necessity in which he was compelled to recognise
          the higher truth; and the wrestling of an earnest spirit for the
          assurance of his personal standing with God, when all the outward
          institutions of religion were being dissolved.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To such mental
          conflicts Ezekiel was a stranger, or if he ever passed through them
          the traces of them have almost vanished from his written words. He
          can hardly be said to be more severe than Jeremiah; but his
          severity <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page017">[pg
          017]</span><a name="Pg017" id="Pg017" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          seems more a part of himself, and more in keeping with the bent of
          his disposition. He is wholly on the side of the divine
          sovereignty; there is no reaction of the human sympathies against
          the imperative dictates of the prophetic inspiration; he is one in
          whom every thought seems brought into captivity to the word of
          Jehovah. It is possible that the completeness with which Ezekiel
          surrendered himself to the judicial aspect of his message may be
          partly due to the fact that he had been familiar with its leading
          conceptions from the teaching of Jeremiah; but it must also be due
          to a certain austerity natural to him. Less emotional than
          Jeremiah, his mind was more readily taken possession of by the
          convictions that formed the substance of his prophetic message. He
          was evidently a man of profoundly ethical habits of thought, stern
          and uncompromising in his judgments, both on himself and other men,
          and gifted with a strong sense of human responsibility. As his
          captivity cut him off from living contact with the national life,
          and enabled him to survey his country's condition with something of
          the dispassionate scrutiny of a spectator, so his natural
          disposition enabled him to realise in his own person that breach
          with the past which was essential to the purification of religion.
          He had the qualities which marked him out for the prophet of the
          new order that was to be, as clearly as Jeremiah had those which
          fitted him to be the prophet of a nation's dissolution. In social
          standing, also, and professional training, the men were far removed
          from each other. Both were priests, but Ezekiel belonged to the
          house of Zadok, who officiated in the central sanctuary, while
          Jeremiah's family may have been attached to one of the provincial
          sanctuaries.<a id="noteref_4" name="noteref_4" href=
          "#note_4"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">4</span></span></a> The
          interests of the two classes of priests came <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page018">[pg 018]</span><a name="Pg018" id="Pg018"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> into sharp collision as a consequence
          of Josiah's reformation. The law provided that the rural priesthood
          should be admitted to the service of the Temple on equal terms with
          their brethren of the sons of Zadok; but we are expressly informed
          that the Temple priests successfully resisted this encroachment on
          their peculiar privileges. It has been adduced by several
          expositors as a proof of Ezekiel's freedom from caste prejudice,
          that he was willing to learn from a man who was socially his
          inferior, and who belonged to an order which he himself was to
          declare unworthy of full priestly rights in the restored theocracy.
          But it must be said that there was little in Jeremiah's public work
          to call attention to the fact that he was by birth a priest. In the
          profound spiritual sense of the Epistle to the Hebrews we may
          indeed say that he was at heart a priest, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“having compassion on the ignorant and them that are
          out of the way, forasmuch as he himself was compassed with
          infirmity.”</span> But this quality of spiritual sympathy sprang
          from his calling as a prophet rather than from his priestly
          training. One of the contrasts between him and Ezekiel lies just in
          the respective estimates of the worth of ritual which underlie
          their teaching. Jeremiah is distinguished even among the prophets
          by his indifference to the outward institutions and symbols of
          religion which it is the priest's function to conserve. He stands
          in the succession of Amos and Isaiah as an upholder of the purely
          ethical character of the service of God. Ritual forms no essential
          element of Jehovah's covenant with Israel, and it is doubtful if
          his prophecies of the future contain any reference to a priestly
          class or priestly ordinances.<a id="noteref_5" name="noteref_5"
          href="#note_5"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">5</span></span></a> In the
          present he <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page019">[pg
          019]</span><a name="Pg019" id="Pg019" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          repudiates the actual popular worship as offensive to Jehovah, and,
          except in so far as he may have given his support to Josiah's
          reforms, he does not concern himself to put anything better in its
          place. To Ezekiel, on the contrary, a pure worship is a primary
          condition of Israel's enjoyment of the fellowship of Jehovah. All
          through his teaching we detect his deep sense of the religious
          value of priestly ceremonies, and in the concluding vision that
          underlying thought comes out clearly as a fundamental principle of
          the new religious constitution. Here again we can see how each
          prophet was providentially fitted for the special work assigned him
          to do. To Jeremiah it was given, amidst the wreck of all the
          material embodiments in which faith had clothed itself in the past,
          to realise the essential truth of religion as personal communion
          with God, and so to rise to the conception of a purely spiritual
          religion, in which the will of God should be written in the heart
          of every believer. To Ezekiel was committed the different, but not
          less necessary, task of organising the religion of the immediate
          future, and providing the forms which were to enshrine the truths
          of revelation until the coming of Christ. And that task could not,
          humanly speaking, have been performed but by one whose training and
          inclination taught him to appreciate the value of those rules of
          ceremonial sanctity which were the tradition of the Hebrew
          priesthood.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Very closely
          connected with this is the attitude of the two prophets to what we
          may call the legal aspect of religion. Jeremiah seems to have
          become convinced at a very early date of the insufficiency and
          shallowness of the revival of religion which was expressed in the
          establishment of the national covenant in the reign of Josiah. He
          seems also to have discerned some of the evils which are
          inseparable from a religion of the letter, in which the claims of
          God are presented in the form of external laws <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page020">[pg 020]</span><a name="Pg020" id="Pg020"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and ordinances. And these convictions
          led him to the conception of a far higher manifestation of God's
          redeeming grace to be realised in the future, in the form of a new
          covenant, based on God's forgiving love, and operative through a
          personal knowledge of God, and the law written on the heart and
          mind of each member of the covenant people. That is to say, the
          living principle of religion must be implanted in the heart of each
          true Israelite, and his obedience must be what we call evangelical
          obedience, springing from the free impulse of a nature renewed by
          the knowledge of God. Ezekiel is also impressed by the failure of
          the Deuteronomic covenant and the need of a new heart before Israel
          is able to comply with the high requirements of the holy law of
          God. But he does not appear to have been led to connect the failure
          of the past with the inherent imperfection of a legal dispensation
          as such. Although his teaching is full of evangelical truths,
          amongst which the doctrine of regeneration holds a conspicuous
          place, we yet observe that with him a man's righteousness before
          God consists in acts of obedience to the objective precepts of the
          divine law. This of course does not mean that Ezekiel was concerned
          only about the outward act and indifferent to the spirit in which
          the law was observed. But it does mean that the end of God's
          dealings with His people was to bring them into a condition for
          fulfilling His law, and that the great aim of the new Israel was
          the faithful observance of the law which expressed the conditions
          on which they could remain in communion with God. Accordingly
          Ezekiel's final ideal is on a lower plane, and therefore more
          immediately practicable, than that of Jeremiah. Instead of a purely
          spiritual anticipation expressing the essential nature of the
          perfect relation between God and man, Ezekiel presents us with a
          definite, clearly conceived vision of a new theocracy—a state which
          is to be the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page021">[pg
          021]</span><a name="Pg021" id="Pg021" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          outward embodiment of Jehovah's will and in which life is minutely
          regulated by His law.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If in spite of
          such wide differences of temperament, of education, and of
          religious experience, we find nevertheless a substantial agreement
          in the teaching of the two prophets, we must certainly recognise in
          this a striking evidence of the stability of that conception of God
          and His providence which was in the main a product of Hebrew
          prophecy. It is not necessary here to enumerate all the points of
          coincidence between Jeremiah and Ezekiel; but it will be of
          advantage to indicate a few salient features which they have in
          common. Of these one of the most important is their conception of
          the prophetic office. It can hardly be doubted that on this subject
          Ezekiel had learned much both from observation of Jeremiah's career
          and from the study of his writings. He knew something of what it
          meant to be a prophet to Israel before he himself received the
          prophet's commission; and after he had received it his experience
          ran closely parallel with that of his master. The idea of the
          prophet as a man standing alone for God amidst a hostile world,
          surrounded on every side by threats and opposition, was impressed
          on each of them from the outset of his ministry. To be a true
          prophet one must know how to confront men with an inflexibility
          equal to theirs, sustained only by a divine power which assures him
          of ultimate victory. He is cut off, not only from the currents of
          opinion which play around him, but from all share in common joys
          and sorrows, living a solitary life in sympathy with a God justly
          alienated from His people. This attitude of antagonism to the
          people, as Jeremiah well knew, had been the common fate of all true
          prophets. What is characteristic of him and Ezekiel is that they
          both enter on their work in the full consciousness of the stern and
          hopeless nature of their task. Isaiah knew from the day he became
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page022">[pg 022]</span><a name=
          "Pg022" id="Pg022" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> a prophet that the
          effect of his teaching would be to harden the people in unbelief;
          but he says nothing of personal enmity and persecution to be faced
          from the outset. But now the crisis of the people's fate has
          arrived, and the relations between the prophet and his age become
          more and more strained as the great controversy approaches its
          decision.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another point of
          agreement which may be here mentioned is the estimate of Israel's
          sin. Ezekiel goes further than Jeremiah in the way of condemnation,
          regarding the whole history of Israel as an unbroken record of
          apostasy and rebellion, while Jeremiah at least looks back to the
          desert wandering as a time when the ideal relation between Israel
          and Jehovah was maintained. But on the whole, and especially with
          respect to the present state of the nation, their judgment is
          substantially one. The source of all the religious and moral
          disorders of the nation is infidelity to Jehovah, which is
          manifested in the worship of false gods and reliance on the help of
          foreign nations. Specially noteworthy is the frequent recurrence in
          Jeremiah and Ezekiel of the figure of <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“whoredom,”</span> an idea introduced into prophecy by
          Hosea to describe these two sins. The extension of the figure to
          the false worship of Jehovah by images and other idolatrous emblems
          can also be traced to Hosea; and in Ezekiel it is sometimes
          difficult to say which species of idolatry he has in view, whether
          it be the actual worship of other gods or the unlawful worship of
          the true God. His position is that an unspiritual worship implies
          an unspiritual deity, and that such service as was performed at the
          ordinary sanctuaries could by no possibility be regarded as
          rendered to the true God who spoke through the prophets. From this
          fountain-head of a corrupted religious sense proceed all those
          immoral practices which both prophets stigmatise as <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“abominations”</span> and as a defilement of the land
          of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page023">[pg 023]</span><a name=
          "Pg023" id="Pg023" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Jehovah. Of these
          the most startling is the prevalent sacrifice of children to which
          they both bear witness, although, as we shall afterwards see, with
          a characteristic difference in their point of view.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The whole
          picture, indeed, which Jeremiah and Ezekiel present of contemporary
          society is appalling in the extreme. Making all allowance for the
          practical motive of the prophetic invective, which always aims at
          conviction of sin, we cannot doubt that the state of things was
          sufficiently serious to mark Judah as ripe for judgment. The very
          foundations of society were sapped by the spread of licence and
          high-handed violence through all classes of the community. The
          restraints of religion had been loosened by the feeling that
          Jehovah had forsaken the land, and nobles, priests, and prophets
          plunged into a career of wickedness and oppression which made
          salvation of the existing nation impossible. The guilt of Jerusalem
          is symbolised to both prophets in the innocent blood which stains
          her skirts and cries to heaven for vengeance. The tendencies which
          are uppermost are the evil legacy of the days of Manasseh, when, in
          the judgment of Jeremiah and the historian of the books of
          Kings,<a id="noteref_6" name="noteref_6" href=
          "#note_6"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">6</span></span></a> the
          nation sinned beyond hope of mercy. In painting his lurid pictures
          of social degeneracy Ezekiel is no doubt drawing on his own memory
          and information; nevertheless the forms in which his indictment is
          cast show that even in this matter he has learned to look on things
          with the eyes of his great teacher.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is scarcely
          necessary to add that both prophets anticipate a speedy downfall of
          the state and its restoration in a more glorious form after a short
          interval, fixed by Jeremiah at seventy years and by Ezekiel at
          forty years. The restoration is regarded as final, and as embracing
          both <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page024">[pg 024]</span><a name=
          "Pg024" id="Pg024" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> branches of the
          Hebrew nation, the kingdom of the ten tribes as well as the house
          of Judah. The Messianic hope in Ezekiel appears in a form similar
          to that in which it is presented by Jeremiah; in neither prophet is
          the figure of the ideal King so prominent as in the prophecies of
          Isaiah. The similarity between the two is all the more noteworthy
          as an evidence of dependence, because Ezekiel's final outlook is
          towards a state of things in which the Prince has a somewhat
          subordinate position assigned to Him. Both prophets, again
          following Hosea, regard the spiritual renewal of the people as the
          effect of chastisement in exile. Those parts of the nation which go
          first into banishment are the first to be brought under the
          salutary influences of God's providential discipline; and hence we
          find that Jeremiah adopts a more hopeful tone in speaking of
          Samaria and the captives of 597 than in his utterances to those who
          remained in the land. This conviction was shared by Ezekiel, in
          spite of his daily contact with abominations from which his whole
          nature revolted. It has been supposed that Ezekiel lived long
          enough to see that no such spiritual transformation was to be
          wrought by the mere fact of captivity, and that, despairing of a
          general and spontaneous conversion, he put his hand to the work of
          practical reform as if he would secure by legislation the results
          which he had once expected as fruits of repentance. If the prophet
          had ever expected that punishment of itself would work a change in
          the religious condition of his countrymen, there might have been
          room for such a disenchantment as is here assumed. But there is no
          evidence that he ever looked for anything else than a regeneration
          of the people in captivity by the supernatural working of the
          divine Spirit; and that the final vision is meant to help out the
          divine plan by human policy is a suggestion negatived by the whole
          scope of the book. It may be true that his practical activity in
          the present was directed to preparing individual men for
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page025">[pg 025]</span><a name=
          "Pg025" id="Pg025" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the coming
          salvation; but that was no more than any spiritual teacher must
          have done in a time recognised as a period of transition. The
          vision of the restored theocracy presupposes a national
          resurrection and a national repentance. And on the face of it it is
          such that man can take no step towards its accomplishment until God
          has prepared the way by creating the conditions of a perfect
          religious community, both the moral conditions in the mind of the
          people and the outward conditions in the miraculous transformation
          of the land in which they are to dwell.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Most of the
          points here touched upon will have to be more fully treated in the
          course of our exposition, and other affinities between the two
          great prophets will have to be noticed as we proceed. Enough has
          perhaps been said to show that Ezekiel's thinking has been
          profoundly influenced by Jeremiah, that the influence extends not
          only to the form but also to the substance of his teaching, and can
          therefore only be explained by early impressions received by the
          younger prophet in the days before the word of the Lord had come to
          him.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It might be
          hazardous to attempt, from the general considerations advanced in
          the last two chapters, to form a conception of Ezekiel's state of
          mind during the first few years of his captivity. If, as we have
          found reason to believe, he had already come under the influence of
          Jeremiah, he must have been in some measure prepared for the blow
          which had descended on him. Torn from the duties of the office
          which he loved, and driven in upon himself, Ezekiel must no doubt
          have meditated deeply on the sin and the prospects of his people.
          From the first he must have stood aloof from his fellow-exiles,
          who, led by their false prophets, began to dream of the fall of
          Babylon and a speedy return to their own land. He knew that the
          calamity which had befallen them was but the first instalment of a
          sweeping judgment before which the old Israel must utterly perish.
          Those who remained in Jerusalem were reserved for a worse fate than
          those who had been carried away; but so long as the latter remained
          impenitent there was no hope even for them of an alleviation of the
          bitterness of their lot. Such thoughts, working in a mind naturally
          severe in its judgments, may have already produced that attitude of
          alienation from the whole life of his companions in misfortune
          which dominates the first period of his prophetic career. But these
          convictions did not make Ezekiel a prophet. He had as yet
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page027">[pg 027]</span><a name=
          "Pg027" id="Pg027" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> no independent
          message from God, no sure perception of the issue of events, or the
          path which Israel must follow in order to reach the blessedness of
          the future. It was not till the fifth year of his captivity<a id=
          "noteref_7" name="noteref_7" href="#note_7"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">7</span></span></a> that
          the inward change took place which brought him into Jehovah's
          counsel, and disclosed to him the outlines of all his future work,
          and endowed him with the courage to stand forth amongst his people
          as the spokesman of Jehovah.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Like other great
          prophets whose personal experience is recorded, Ezekiel became
          conscious of his prophetic vocation through a vision of God. The
          form in which Jehovah first appeared to him is described with great
          minuteness of detail in the first chapter of his book. It would
          seem that in some hour of solitary meditation by the river Kebar
          his attention was attracted to a storm-cloud forming in the north
          and advancing toward him across the plain. The cloud may have been
          an actual phenomenon, the natural basis of the theophany which
          follows. Falling into a state of ecstasy, the prophet sees the
          cloud grow luminous with an unearthly splendour. From the midst of
          it there shines a brightness which he compares to the lustre of
          electron.<a id="noteref_8" name="noteref_8" href=
          "#note_8"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">8</span></span></a> Looking
          more closely, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page028">[pg
          028]</span><a name="Pg028" id="Pg028" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          he discerns four living creatures, of strange composite form,—human
          in general appearance, but winged; and each having four heads
          combining the highest types of animal life—man, lion, ox, and
          eagle. These are afterwards identified with the cherubim of the
          Temple symbolism (ch. x. 20); but some features of the conception
          may have been suggested by the composite animal figures of
          Babylonian art, with which the prophet must have been already
          familiar. The interior space is occupied by a hearth of glowing
          coals, from which lightning-flashes constantly dart to and fro
          between the cherubim. Beside each cherub is a wheel, formed
          apparently of two wheels intersecting each other at right angles.
          The appearance of the wheels is like <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“chrysolite,”</span> and their rims are filled with
          eyes, denoting the intelligence by which their motions are
          directed. The wheels and the cherubim together embody the
          spontaneous energy by which the throne of God is transported
          whither He wills; although there is no mechanical connection
          between them, they are represented as animated by a common spirit,
          directing all their motions in perfect harmony. Over the heads and
          out-stretched wings of the cherubim is a rigid pavement or
          <span class="tei tei-q">“firmament,”</span> like crystal; and above
          this a sapphire stone<a id="noteref_9" name="noteref_9" href=
          "#note_9"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">9</span></span></a>
          supporting the throne of Jehovah. The divine Being is seen in the
          likeness of a man; and around Him, as if to temper the fierceness
          of the light in which He dwells, is a radiance like that of the
          rainbow. It will be noticed that while Ezekiel's imagination dwells
          on what we must consider the accessories of the vision—the fire,
          the cherubim, the wheels—he hardly dares to lift his eyes to the
          person of Jehovah Himself. The full meaning of what he is passing
          through only dawns on him when he realises that he is in the
          presence of the Almighty. Then he <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page029">[pg 029]</span><a name="Pg029" id="Pg029" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> falls on his face overpowered by the sense of
          his own insignificance.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is no
          reason to doubt that what is thus described represents an actual
          experience on the part of the prophet. It is not to be regarded
          merely as a conscious clothing of spiritual truths in symbolic
          imagery. The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">description</span></em> of a vision is of
          course a conscious exercise of literary faculty; and in all such
          cases it must be difficult to distinguish what a prophet actually
          saw and heard in the moment of inspiration from the details which
          he was compelled to add in order to convey an intelligible picture
          to the minds of his readers. It is probable that in the case of
          Ezekiel the element of free invention has a larger range than in
          the less elaborate descriptions which other prophets give of their
          visions. But this does not detract from the force of the prophet's
          own assertion that what he relates was based on a real and definite
          experience when in a state of prophetic ecstasy. This is expressed
          by the words <span class="tei tei-q">“the hand of Jehovah was upon
          him”</span> (ver. 3)—a phrase which is invariably used throughout
          the book to denote the prophet's peculiar mental condition when the
          communication of divine truth was accompanied by experiences of a
          visionary order. Moreover, the account given of the state in which
          this vision left him shows that his natural consciousness had been
          overpowered by the pressure of super-sensible realities on his
          spirit. He tells us that he went <span class="tei tei-q">“in
          bitterness, in the heat of his spirit, the hand of the Lord being
          heavy upon him; and came to the exiles at Tel-abib, ... and sat
          there seven days stupefied in their midst”</span> (ch. iii. 14,
          15).</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now whatever be
          the ultimate nature of the prophetic vision, its significance for
          us would appear to lie in the untrammelled working of the prophet's
          imagination under the influence of spiritual perceptions which are
          too profound to be expressed as abstract ideas. The prophet's
          consciousness <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page030">[pg
          030]</span><a name="Pg030" id="Pg030" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          is not suspended, for he remembers his vision and reflects on its
          meaning afterwards; but his intercourse with the outer world
          through the senses is interrupted, so that his mind moves freely
          amongst images stored in his memory, and new combinations are
          formed which embody a truth not previously apprehended. The
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tableau</span></em> of the vision is therefore
          always capable to some extent of a psychological explanation. The
          elements of which it is composed must have been already present in
          the mind of the prophet, and in so far as these can be traced to
          their sources we are enabled to understand their symbolic import in
          the novel combination in which they appear. But the real
          significance of the vision lies in the immediate impression left on
          the mind of the prophet by the divine realities which govern his
          life, and this is especially true of the vision of God Himself
          which accompanies the call to the prophetic office. Although no
          vision can express the whole of a prophet's conception of God, yet
          it represents to the imagination certain fundamental aspects of the
          divine nature and of God's relation to the world and to men; and
          through all his subsequent career the prophet will be influenced by
          the form in which he once beheld the great Being whose words come
          to him from time to time. To his later reflection the vision
          becomes a symbol of certain truths about God, although in the first
          instance the symbol was created for him by a mysterious operation
          of the divine Spirit in a process over which he had no control. In
          one respect Ezekiel's inaugural vision seems to possess a greater
          importance for his theology than is the case with any other
          prophet. With the other prophets the vision is a momentary
          experience, of which the spiritual meaning passes into the thinking
          of the prophet, but which does not recur again in the visionary
          form. With Ezekiel, on the other hand, the vision becomes a fixed
          and permanent symbol of Jehovah, appearing <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page031">[pg 031]</span><a name="Pg031" id="Pg031" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> again and again in precisely the same form as
          often as the reality of God's presence is impressed on his
          mind.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The essential
          question, then, with regard to Ezekiel's vision is, What revelation
          of God or what ideas respecting God did it serve to impress on the
          mind of the prophet? It may help us to answer that question if we
          begin by considering certain affinities which it presents to the
          great vision which opened the ministry of Isaiah. It must be
          admitted that Ezekiel's experience is much less intelligible as
          well as less impressive than Isaiah's. In Isaiah's delineation we
          recognise the presence of qualities which belong to genius of the
          highest order. The perfect balance of form and idea, the reticence
          which suggests without exhausting the significance of what is seen,
          the fine artistic sense which makes every touch in the picture
          contribute to the rendering of the emotion which fills the
          prophet's soul, combine to make the sixth chapter of Isaiah one of
          the most sublime passages in literature. No sympathetic reader can
          fail to catch the impression which the passage is intended to
          convey of the awful majesty of the God of Israel, and the effect
          produced on a frail and sinful mortal ushered into that holy
          Presence. We are made to feel how inevitably such a vision gives
          birth to the prophetic impulse, and how both vision and impulse
          inform the mind of the seer with the clear and definite purpose
          which rules all his subsequent work.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The point in
          which Ezekiel's vision differs most strikingly from Isaiah's is the
          almost entire suppression of his subjectivity. This is so complete
          that it becomes difficult to apprehend the meaning of the vision in
          relation to his thought and activity. Spiritual realities are so
          overlaid with symbolism that the narrative almost fails to reflect
          the mental state in which he was consecrated for the work of his
          life. Isaiah's vision is a drama, Ezekiel's is a spectacle; in the
          one religious truth is <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page032">[pg
          032]</span><a name="Pg032" id="Pg032" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          expressed in a series of significant actions and words, in the
          other it is embodied in forms and splendours that appeal only to
          the eye. One fact may be noted in illustration of the diversity
          between the two representations. The scenery of Isaiah's vision is
          interpreted and spiritualised by the medium of language. The
          seraphs' hymn of adoration strikes the note which is the central
          thought of the vision, and the exclamation which breaks from the
          prophet's lips reveals the impact of that great truth on a human
          spirit. The whole scene is thus lifted out of the region of mere
          symbolism into that of pure religious ideas. Ezekiel's, on the
          other hand, is like a song without words. His cherubim are
          speechless. While the rustling of their wings and the thunder of
          the revolving wheels break on his ear like the sound of mighty
          waters, no articulate voice bears home to the mind the inner
          meaning of what he beholds. Probably he himself felt no need of it.
          The pictorial character of his thinking appears in many features of
          his work; and it is not surprising to find that the import of the
          revelation is expressed mainly in visual images.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now these
          differences are in their own place very instructive, because they
          show how intimately the vision is related to the individuality of
          him who receives it, and how even in the most exalted moments of
          inspiration the mind displays the same tendencies which
          characterise its ordinary operations. Yet Ezekiel's vision
          represents a spiritual experience not less real than Isaiah's. His
          mental endowments are of a different order, of a lower order if you
          will, than those of Isaiah; but the essential fact that he too saw
          the glory of God and in that vision obtained the insight of the
          true prophet is not to be explained away by analysis of his
          literary talent or of the sources from which his images are
          derived. It is allowable to write worse Greek than Plato; and it is
          no disqualification for a Hebrew prophet to lack the grandeur
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page033">[pg 033]</span><a name=
          "Pg033" id="Pg033" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of imagination and
          the mastery of style which are the notes of Isaiah's genius.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In spite of
          their obvious dissimilarities the two visions have enough in common
          to show that Ezekiel's thoughts concerning God had been largely
          influenced by the study of Isaiah. Truths that had perhaps long
          been latent in his mind now emerge into clear consciousness,
          clothed in forms which bear the impress of the mind in which they
          were first conceived. The fundamental idea is the same in each
          vision: the absolute and universal sovereignty of God. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Mine eyes have seen the King, Jehovah of
          hosts.”</span> Jehovah appears in human form, seated on a throne
          and attended by ministering creatures which serve to show forth
          some part of His glory. In the one case they are seraphim, in the
          other cherubim; and the functions imposed on them by the structure
          of the vision are very diverse in the two cases. But the points in
          which they agree are more significant than those in which they
          differ. They are the agents through whom Jehovah exercises His
          sovereign authority, beings full of life and intelligence and
          moving in swift response to His will. Although free from earthly
          imperfection they cover themselves with their wings before His
          majesty, in token of the reverence which is due from the creature
          in presence of the Creator. For the rest they are symbolic figures
          embodying in themselves certain attributes of the Deity, or certain
          aspects of His kingship. Nor can Ezekiel any more than Isaiah think
          of Jehovah as the King apart from the emblems associated with the
          worship of His earthly sanctuary. The cherubim themselves are
          borrowed from the imagery of the Temple, although their forms are
          different from those which stood in the Holy of holies. So again
          the altar, which was naturally suggested to Isaiah by the scene of
          his vision being laid in the Temple, appears in Ezekiel's vision in
          the form of the hearth of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page034">[pg
          034]</span><a name="Pg034" id="Pg034" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          glowing coals which is under the divine throne. It is true that the
          fire symbolises destructive might rather than purifying energy (see
          ch. x. 2), but it can hardly be doubted that the origin of the
          symbol is the altar-hearth of the sanctuary and of Isaiah's vision.
          It is as if the essence of the Temple and its worship were
          transferred to the sphere of heavenly realities where Jehovah's
          glory is fully manifested. All this, therefore, is nothing more
          than the embodiment of the fundamental truth of the Old Testament
          religion—that Jehovah is the almighty King of heaven and earth,
          that He executes His sovereign purposes with irresistible power,
          and that it is the highest privilege of men on earth to render to
          Him the homage and adoration which the sight of His glory draws
          forth from heavenly beings.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The idea of
          Jehovah's kingship, however, is presented in the Old Testament
          under two aspects. On the one hand, it denotes the moral
          sovereignty of God over the people whom He had chosen as His own
          and to whom His will was continuously revealed as the guide of
          their national and social life. On the other hand, it denotes God's
          absolute dominion over the forces of nature and the events of
          history, in virtue of which all things are the unconscious
          instruments of His purposes. These two truths can never be
          separated, although the emphasis is laid sometimes on the one and
          sometimes on the other. Thus in Isaiah's vision the emphasis lies
          perhaps more on the doctrine of Jehovah's kingship over Israel. It
          is true that He is at the same time represented as One whose glory
          is the <span class="tei tei-q">“fulness of the whole earth,”</span>
          and who therefore manifests His power and presence in every part of
          His world-wide dominions. But the fact that Jehovah's palace is the
          idealised Temple of Jerusalem suggests at once, what all the
          teaching of the prophet confirms, that the nation of Israel is the
          special sphere within which His kingly <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page035">[pg 035]</span><a name="Pg035" id="Pg035" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> authority is to obtain practical recognition.
          While no man had a firmer grasp of the truth that God wields all
          natural forces and overrules the actions of men in carrying out His
          providential designs, yet the leading ideas of His ministry are
          those which spring from the thought of Jehovah's presence in the
          midst of His people and the obligation that lies on Israel to
          recognise His sovereignty. He is, to use Isaiah's own expression,
          the <span class="tei tei-q">“Holy One of Israel.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This aspect of
          the divine kingship is undoubtedly represented in the vision of
          Ezekiel. We have remarked that the imagery of the vision is to some
          extent moulded on the idea of the sanctuary as the seat of
          Jehovah's government, and we shall find later on that the final
          resting-place of this emblem of His presence is a restored
          sanctuary in the land of Canaan. But the circumstances under which
          Ezekiel was called to be a prophet required that prominence should
          be given to the complementary truth that the kingship of Jehovah
          was independent of His special relation to Israel. For the present
          the tie between Jehovah and His land was dissolved. Israel had
          disowned her divine King, and was left to suffer the consequences
          of her disloyalty. Hence it is that the vision appears, not from
          the direction of Jerusalem, but <span class="tei tei-q">“out of the
          north,”</span> in token that God has departed from His Temple and
          abandoned it to its enemies. In this way the vision granted to the
          exiled prophet on the plain of Babylonia embodied a truth opposed
          to the religious prejudices of his time, but reassuring to
          himself—that the fall of Israel leaves the essential sovereignty of
          Jehovah untouched; that He still lives and reigns, although His
          people are trodden underfoot by worshippers of other gods. But more
          than this, we can see that on the whole the tendency of Ezekiel's
          vision, as distinguished from that of Isaiah, is to emphasise the
          universality of Jehovah's <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page036">[pg
          036]</span><a name="Pg036" id="Pg036" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          relations to the world of nature and of mankind. His throne rests
          here on a sapphire stone, the symbol of heavenly purity, to signify
          that His true dwelling-place is above the firmament, in the
          heavens, which are equally near to every region of the earth.
          Moreover, it is mounted on a chariot, by which it is moved from
          place to place with a velocity which suggests ubiquity, and the
          chariot is borne by <span class="tei tei-q">“living
          creatures”</span> whose forms unite all that is symbolical of power
          and dignity in the living world. Further, the shape of the chariot,
          which is foursquare, and the disposition of the wheels and
          cherubim, which is such that there is no before or behind, but the
          same front presented to each of the four quarters of the globe,
          indicate that all parts of the universe are alike accessible to the
          presence of God. Finally, the wheels and the cherubim are covered
          with eyes, to denote that all things are open to the view of Him
          who sits on the throne. The attributes of God here symbolised are
          those which express His relations to created existence as a
          whole—omnipresence, omnipotence, omniscience. These ideas are
          obviously incapable of adequate representation by any sensuous
          image—they can only be suggested to the mind; and it is just the
          effort to suggest such transcendental attributes that imparts to
          the vision the character of obscurity which attaches to so many of
          its details.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another point of
          comparison between Isaiah and Ezekiel is suggested by the name
          which the latter constantly uses for the appearance which he sees,
          or rather perhaps for that part of it which represents the personal
          appearance of God. He calls it the <span class="tei tei-q">“glory
          of Jehovah,”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“glory of the God of
          Israel.”</span> The word for glory (<span lang="he" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="he"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">kābôd</span></span>) is used in a variety of
          senses in the Old Testament. Etymologically it comes from a root
          expressing the idea of heaviness. When used, as here, concretely,
          it signifies that which is the outward manifestation of power or
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page037">[pg 037]</span><a name=
          "Pg037" id="Pg037" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> worth or dignity. In
          human affairs it may be used of a man's wealth, or the pomp and
          circumstance of military array, or the splendour and pageantry of a
          royal court, those things which oppress the minds of common men
          with a sense of magnificence. In like manner, when applied to God,
          it denotes some reflection in the outer world of His majesty,
          something that at once reveals and conceals His essential Godhead.
          Now we remember that the second line of the seraphs' hymn conveyed
          to Isaiah's mind this thought, that <span class="tei tei-q">“that
          which fills the whole earth is His glory.”</span> What is this
          <span class="tei tei-q">“filling of the whole earth”</span> in
          which the prophet sees the effulgence of the divine glory? Is his
          feeling akin to Wordsworth's</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At least the
          words must surely mean that all through nature Isaiah recognised
          that which declares the glory of God, and therefore in some sense
          reveals Him. Although they do not teach a doctrine of the divine
          immanence, they contain all that is religiously valuable in that
          doctrine. In Ezekiel, however, we find nothing that looks in this
          direction. It is characteristic of his thoughts about God that the
          very word <span class="tei tei-q">“glory”</span> which Isaiah uses
          of something diffused through the earth is here employed to express
          the concentration of all divine qualities in a single image of
          dazzling splendour, but belonging to heaven rather than to earth.
          Glory is here equivalent to brightness, as in the ancient
          conception of the bright cloud which led the people through the
          desert and that which filled the Temple with overpowering light
          when Jehovah took possession of it (2 Chron. vii. 1-3). In a
          striking passage of his last <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page038">[pg 038]</span><a name="Pg038" id="Pg038" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> vision Ezekiel describes how this scene will
          be repeated when Jehovah returns to take up His abode amongst His
          people and the earth will be lighted up with His glory (ch. xliii.
          2). But meanwhile it may seem to us that earth is left poorer by
          the loss of that aspect of nature in which Isaiah discovered a
          revelation of the divine.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Ezekiel is
          conscious that what he has seen is after all but an imperfect
          semblance of the essential glory of God on which no mortal eye can
          gaze. All that he describes is expressly said to be an <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“appearance”</span> and a <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“likeness.”</span> When he comes to speak of the divine
          form in which the whole revelation culminates he can say no more
          than that it is the <span class="tei tei-q">“appearance of the
          likeness of the glory of Jehovah.”</span> The prophet appears to
          realise his inability to penetrate behind the appearance to the
          reality which it shadows forth. The clearest vision of God which
          the mind of man can receive is an after-look like that which was
          vouchsafed to Moses when the divine presence had passed by (Exod.
          xxxiii. 23). So it was with Ezekiel. The true revelation that came
          to him was not in what he saw with his eyes in the moment of his
          initiation, but in the intuitive knowledge of God which from that
          hour he possessed, and which enabled him to interpret more fully
          than he could have done at the time the significance of his first
          memorable meeting with the God of Israel. What he retained in his
          waking hours was first of all a vivid sense of the reality of God's
          being, and then a mental picture suggesting those attributes which
          lay at the foundation of his prophetic ministry.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is easy to
          see how this vision dominates all Ezekiel's thinking about the
          divine nature. The God whom he saw was in the form of a man, and so
          the God of his conscience is a moral person to whom he fearlessly
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page039">[pg 039]</span><a name=
          "Pg039" id="Pg039" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> ascribes the parts
          and even the passions of humanity. He speaks through the prophet in
          the language of royal authority, as a king who will brook no rival
          in the affections of his people. As King of Israel He asserts His
          determination to reign over them with a mighty hand, and by mingled
          goodness and severity to break their stubborn heart and bend them
          to His purpose. There are perhaps other and more subtle affinities
          between the symbol of the vision and the prophet's inner
          consciousness of God. Just as the vision gathers up all in nature
          that suggests divinity into one resplendent image, so it is also
          with the moral action of God as conceived by Ezekiel. His
          government of the world is self-centred; all the ends which He
          pursues in His providence lie within Himself. His dealings with the
          nations, and with Israel in particular, are dictated by regard for
          His own glory, or, as Ezekiel expresses it, by pity for His great
          name. <span class="tei tei-q">“Not for your sake do I act, O house
          of Israel, but for My holy name, which ye have profaned among the
          heathen whither ye went”</span> (ch. xxxvi. 22). The relations into
          which He enters with men are all subordinate to the supreme purpose
          of <span class="tei tei-q">“sanctifying”</span> Himself in the eyes
          of the world or manifesting Himself as He truly is. It is no doubt
          possible to exaggerate this feature of Ezekiel's theology in a way
          that would be unjust to the prophet. After all, Jehovah's desire to
          be known as He is implies a regard for His creatures which includes
          the ultimate intention to bless them. It is but an extreme
          expression in the form necessary for that time of the truth to
          which all the prophets bear witness, that the knowledge of God is
          the indispensable condition of true blessedness to men. Still, the
          difference is marked between the <span class="tei tei-q">“not for
          your sake”</span> of Ezekiel and the <span class="tei tei-q">“human
          bands, the cords of love”</span> of which Hosea speaks, the
          yearning and compassionate affection that binds Jehovah to His
          erring people.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page040">[pg
          040]</span><a name="Pg040" id="Pg040" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In another
          respect the symbolism of the vision may be taken as an emblem of
          the Hebrew conception of the universe. The Bible has no scientific
          theory of God's relation to the world; but it is full of the
          practical conviction that all nature responds to His behests, that
          all occurrences are indications of His mind, the whole realm of
          nature and history being governed by one Will which works for moral
          ends. That conviction is as deeply rooted in the thinking of
          Ezekiel as in that of any other prophet, and, consciously or
          unconsciously, it is reflected in the structure of the <span lang=
          "he" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="he"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">merkābā</span></span>, or heavenly chariot,
          which has no mechanical connection between its different parts, and
          yet is animated by one spirit and moves altogether at the impulse
          of Jehovah's will.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It will be seen
          that the general tendency of Ezekiel's conception of God is what
          might be described in modern language as <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“transcendental.”</span> In this, however, the prophet
          does not stand alone, and the difference between him and earlier
          prophets is not so great as is sometimes represented. Indeed, the
          contrast between transcendent and immanent is hardly applicable in
          the Old Testament religion. If by transcendence it is meant that
          God is a being distinct from the world, not losing Himself in the
          life of nature, but ruling over it and controlling it as His
          instrument, then all the inspired writers of the Old Testament are
          transcendentalists. But this does not mean that God is separated
          from the human spirit by a dead, mechanical universe which owes
          nothing to its Creator but its initial impulse and its governing
          laws. The idea that a world could come between man and God is one
          that would never have occurred to a prophet. Just because God is
          above the world He can reveal Himself directly to the spirit of
          man, speaking to His servants face to face as a man speaketh to his
          friend.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But frequently
          in the prophets the thought is expressed <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page041">[pg 041]</span><a name="Pg041" id="Pg041" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> that Jehovah is <span class="tei tei-q">“far
          off”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“comes from far”</span> in
          the crises of His people's history. <span class="tei tei-q">“Am I a
          God at hand, saith Jehovah, and not a God afar off?”</span> is
          Jeremiah's question to the false prophets of his day; and the
          answer is, <span class="tei tei-q">“Do not I fill heaven and earth?
          saith Jehovah.”</span> On this subject we may quote the suggestive
          remarks of a recent commentator on Isaiah: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The local deities, the gods of the tribal religions,
          are near; Jehovah is far, but at the same time everywhere present.
          The remoteness of Jehovah in space represented to the prophets
          better than our transcendental abstractions Jehovah's absolute
          ascendency. This <span class="tei tei-q">‘far off’</span> is spoken
          with enthusiasm. Everywhere and nowhere, Jehovah comes when His
          hour is come.”</span><a id="noteref_10" name="noteref_10" href=
          "#note_10"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">10</span></span></a> That
          is the idea of Ezekiel's vision. God comes to him <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“from far,”</span> but He comes very near. Our
          difficulty may be to realise the nearness of God. Scientific
          discovery has so enlarged our view of the material universe that we
          feel the need of every consideration that can bring home to us a
          sense of the divine condescension and interest in man's earthly
          history and his spiritual welfare. But the difficulty which beset
          the ordinary Israelite even so late as the Exile was as nearly as
          possible the opposite of ours. His temptation was to think of God
          as only a God <span class="tei tei-q">“at hand,”</span> a local
          deity, whose range of influence was limited to a particular spot,
          and whose power was measured by the fortunes of His own people.
          Above all things he needed to learn that God was <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“afar off,”</span> filling heaven and earth, that His
          power was exerted everywhere, and that there was no place where
          either a man could hide himself from God or God was hidden from
          man. When we bear in mind these circumstances we can see how
          needful was the revelation of the divine omnipresence as a step
          towards the perfect knowledge of God which comes to us through
          Jesus Christ.</p>

          Commission. Chapters ii., iii.</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The call of a
          prophet and the vision of God which sometimes accompanied it are
          the two sides of one complex experience. The man who has truly seen
          God necessarily has a message to men. Not only are his spiritual
          perceptions quickened and all the powers of his being stirred to
          the highest activity, but there is laid on his conscience the
          burden of a sacred duty and a lifelong vocation to the service of
          God and man. The true prophet therefore is one who can say with
          Paul, <span class="tei tei-q">“I was not disobedient to the
          heavenly vision,”</span> for that cannot be a real vision of God
          which does not demand obedience. And of the two elements the call
          is the one that is indispensable to the idea of a prophet. We can
          conceive a prophet without an ecstatic vision, but not without a
          consciousness of being chosen by God for a special work or a sense
          of moral responsibility for the faithful declaration of His truth.
          Whether, as with Isaiah and Ezekiel, the call springs out of the
          vision of God, or whether, as with Jeremiah, the call comes first
          and is supplemented by experiences of a visionary kind, the
          essential fact in the prophet's initiation always is the conviction
          that from a certain period in his life the word of Jehovah came to
          him, and along with it the feeling of personal obligation to God
          for the discharge of a mission entrusted to him. While the vision
          merely serves to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page043">[pg
          043]</span><a name="Pg043" id="Pg043" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          impress on the imagination by means of symbols a certain conception
          of God's being, and may be dispensed with when symbols are no
          longer the necessary vehicle of spiritual truth, the call, as
          conveying a sense of one's true place in the kingdom of God, can
          never be wanting to any man who has a prophetic work to do for God
          amongst his fellow-men.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It has been
          already hinted that in the case of Ezekiel the connection between
          the call and the vision is less obvious than in that of Isaiah. The
          character of the narrative undergoes a change at the beginning of
          ch. ii. The first part is moulded, as we have seen, very largely on
          the inaugural vision of Isaiah; the second betrays with equal
          clearness the influence of Jeremiah. The appearance of a break
          between the first chapter and the second is partly due to the
          prophet's laborious manner of describing what he had passed
          through. It is altogether unfair to represent him as having first
          curiously inspected the mechanism of the <span lang="he" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="he"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">merkābā</span></span>, and then bethought
          himself that it was a fitting thing to fall on his face before it.
          The experience of an ecstasy is one thing, the relating of it is
          another. In much less time than it takes us to master the details
          of the picture, Ezekiel had seen and been overpowered by the glory
          of Jehovah, and had become aware of the purpose for which it had
          been revealed to him. He knew that God had come to him in order to
          send him as a prophet to his fellow-exiles. And just as the
          description of the vision draws out in detail those features which
          were significant of God's nature and attributes, so in what follows
          he becomes conscious step by step of certain aspects of the work to
          which he is called. In the form of a series of addresses of the
          Almighty there are presented to his mind the outlines of his
          prophetic career—its conditions, its hardships, its encouragements,
          and above all its binding and peremptory <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page044">[pg 044]</span><a name="Pg044" id="Pg044" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> obligation. Some of the facts now set before
          him, such as the spiritual condition of his audience, had long been
          familiar to his thoughts—others were new; but now they all take
          their proper place in the scheme of his life; he is made to know
          their bearing on his work, and what attitude he is to adopt in face
          of them. All this takes place in the prophetic trance; but the
          ideas remain with him as the sustaining principles of his
          subsequent work.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">1. Of the truths
          thus presented to the mind of Ezekiel the first, and the one that
          directly arises out of the impression which the vision made on him,
          is his personal insignificance. As he lies prostrate before the
          glory of Jehovah he hears for the first time the name which ever
          afterwards signalises his relation to the God who speaks through
          him. It hardly needs to be said that the term <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“son of man”</span> in the book of Ezekiel is no title
          of honour or of distinction. It is precisely the opposite of this.
          It denotes the absence of distinction in the person of the prophet.
          It signifies no more than <span class="tei tei-q">“member of the
          human race”</span>; its sense might almost be conveyed if we were
          to render it by the word <span class="tei tei-q">“mortal.”</span>
          It expresses the infinite contrast between the heavenly and the
          earthly, between the glorious Being who speaks from the throne and
          the frail creature who needs to be supernaturally strengthened
          before he can stand upright in the attitude of service (ch. ii. 1).
          He felt that there was no reason in himself for the choice which
          God made of him to be a prophet. He is conscious only of the
          attributes which he has in common with the race—of human weakness
          and insignificance; all that distinguishes him from other men
          belongs to his office, and is conferred on him by God in the act of
          his consecration. There is no trace of the generous impulse that
          prompted Isaiah to offer himself as a servant of the great King as
          soon as he realised that there was work to be done. He is equally a
          stranger <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page045">[pg
          045]</span><a name="Pg045" id="Pg045" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          to the shrinking of Jeremiah's sensitive spirit from the
          responsibilities of the prophet's charge. To Ezekiel the divine
          Presence is so overpowering, the command is so definite and
          exacting, that no room is left for the play of personal feeling;
          the hand of the Lord is heavy on him, and he can do nothing but
          stand still and hear.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">2. The next
          thought that occupies the attention of the prophet is the spiritual
          condition of those to whom he is sent. It is to be noted that his
          mission presents itself to him from the outset in two aspects. In
          the first place, he is a prophet to the whole house of Israel,
          including the lost kingdom of the ten tribes, as well as the two
          sections of the kingdom of Judah, those now in exile and those
          still remaining in their own land. This is his ideal audience; the
          sweep of his prophecy is to embrace the destinies of the nation as
          a whole, although but a small part be within the reach of his
          spoken words. But in literal fact he is to be the prophet of the
          exiles (ch. iii. 11); that is the sphere in which he has to make
          proof of his ministry. These two audiences are for the most part
          not distinguished in the mind of Ezekiel; he sees the ideal in the
          real, regarding the little colony in which he lives as an epitome
          of the national life. But in both aspects of his work the outlook
          is equally dispiriting. If he looks forward to an active career
          amongst his fellow-captives, he is given to know that <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“thorns and thistles”</span> are with him and that his
          dwelling is among scorpions (ch. ii. 6). Petty persecution and
          rancorous opposition are the inevitable lot of a prophet there. And
          if he extends his thoughts to the idealised nation he has to think
          of a people whose character is revealed in a long history of
          rebellion and apostasy: they are <span class="tei tei-q">“the
          rebels who have rebelled against Me, they and their fathers to this
          very day”</span> (ch. ii. 3). The greatest difficulty he will have
          to contend with is the impenetrability of the minds of his hearers
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page046">[pg 046]</span><a name=
          "Pg046" id="Pg046" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> to the truths of his
          message. The barrier of a strange language suggests an illustration
          of the impossibility of communicating spiritual ideas to such men
          as he is sent to. But it is a far more hopeless barrier that
          separates him from his people. <span class="tei tei-q">“Not to a
          people of deep speech and heavy tongue art thou sent; and not to
          many peoples whose language thou canst not understand: if I had
          sent thee to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">them</span></em>, <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">they</span></em>
          would hear thee. But the house of Israel will refuse to hear thee;
          for they refuse to hear Me: for the whole house of Israel are hard
          of forehead and stout of heart”</span> (ch. iii. 5-7). The meaning
          is that the incapacity of the people is not intellectual, but moral
          and spiritual. They can understand the prophet's words, but they
          will not hear them because they dislike the truth which he utters
          and have rebelled against the God who sent him. The hardening of
          the national conscience which Isaiah foresaw as the inevitable
          result of his own ministry is already accomplished, and Ezekiel
          traces it to its source in a defect of the will, an aversion to the
          truths which express the character of Jehovah.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This fixed
          judgment on his contemporaries with which Ezekiel enters on his
          work is condensed into one of those stereotyped expressions which
          abound in his writings: <span class="tei tei-q">“house of
          disobedience”</span><a id="noteref_11" name="noteref_11" href=
          "#note_11"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">11</span></span></a>—a
          phrase which is afterwards amplified in more than one elaborate
          review of the nation's past. It no doubt sums up the result of much
          previous meditation on the state of Israel and the possibility of a
          national reformation. If any hope had hitherto lingered in
          Ezekiel's mind that the exiles might now respond to a true word
          from Jehovah, it disappears in the clear insight which he obtains
          into the state of their hearts. He sees that the time has not yet
          come to win the people <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page047">[pg
          047]</span><a name="Pg047" id="Pg047" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          back to God by assurances of His compassion and the nearness of His
          salvation. The breach between Jehovah and Israel has not begun to
          be healed, and the prophet who stands on the side of God must look
          for no sympathy from men. In the very act of his consecration his
          mind is thus set in the attitude of uncompromising severity towards
          the obdurate house of Israel: <span class="tei tei-q">“Behold, I
          make thy face hard like their faces, and thy forehead hard like
          theirs, like adamant harder than flint. Thou shalt not fear them
          nor be dismayed at their countenance, for a disobedient house are
          they”</span> (ch. iii. 8, 9).</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">3. The
          significance of the transaction in which he takes part is still
          further impressed on the mind of the prophet by a symbolic act in
          which he is made to signify his acceptance of the commission
          entrusted to him (chs. ii. 8-iii. 3). He sees a hand extended to
          him holding the roll of a book, and when the roll is spread out
          before him it is found to be written on both sides with
          <span class="tei tei-q">“lamentations and mourning and woe.”</span>
          In obedience to the divine command he opens his mouth and eats the
          scroll, and finds to his surprise that in spite of its contents its
          taste is <span class="tei tei-q">“like honey for
          sweetness.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The meaning of
          this strange symbol appears to include two things. In the first
          place it denotes the removal of the inward hindrance of which every
          man must be conscious when he receives the call to be a prophet.
          Something similar occurs in the inaugural vision of Isaiah and
          Jeremiah. The impediment of which Isaiah was conscious was the
          uncleanness of his lips; and this being removed by the touch of the
          hot coal from the altar, he is filled with a new feeling of freedom
          and eagerness to engage in the service of God. In the case of
          Jeremiah the hindrance was a sense of his own weakness and
          unfitness for the arduous duties which were imposed on him; and
          this again was taken away <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page048">[pg
          048]</span><a name="Pg048" id="Pg048" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          by the consecrating touch of Jehovah's hand on his lips. The part
          of Ezekiel's experience with which we are dealing is obviously
          parallel to these, although it is not possible to say what feeling
          of incapacity was uppermost in his mind. Perhaps it was the dread
          lest in him there should lurk something of that rebellious spirit
          which was the characteristic of the race to which he belonged. He
          who had been led to form so hard a judgment of his people could not
          but look with a jealous eye on his own heart, and could not forget
          that he shared the same sinful nature which made their rebellion
          possible. Accordingly the book is presented to him in the first
          instance as a test of his obedience. <span class="tei tei-q">“But
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">thou</span></em>, son of man, hear what I say
          to thee; Be not disobedient like the disobedient house: open thy
          mouth, and eat what I give thee”</span> (ch. ii. 8). When the book
          proves sweet to his taste, he has the assurance that he has been
          endowed with such sympathy with the thoughts of God that things
          which to the natural mind are unwelcome become the source of a
          spiritual satisfaction. Jeremiah had expressed the same strange
          delight in his work in a striking passage which was doubtless
          familiar to Ezekiel: <span class="tei tei-q">“When Thy words were
          found I did eat them; and Thy word was to me the joy and rejoicing
          of my heart: for I was called by Thy name, O Jehovah God of
          hosts”</span> (Jer. xv. 16). We have a still higher illustration of
          the same fact in the life of our Lord, to whom it was meat and
          drink to do the will of His Father, and who experienced a joy in
          the doing of it which was peculiarly His own. It is the reward of
          the true service of God that amidst all the hardships and
          discouragements which have to be endured the heart is sustained by
          an inward joy springing from the consciousness of working in
          fellowship with God.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But in the
          second place the eating of the book undoubtedly signifies the
          bestowal on the prophet of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          "tei tei-anchor"></a> gift of inspiration—that is, the power to
          speak the words of Jehovah. <span class="tei tei-q">“Son of man,
          eat this roll, and go speak to the children of Israel.... Go, get
          thee to the house of Israel, and speak with My words to
          them”</span> (ch. iii. 1, 4). Now the call of a prophet does not
          mean that his mind is charged with a certain body of doctrine,
          which he is to deliver from time to time as circumstances require.
          All that can safely be said about the prophetic inspiration is that
          it implies the faculty of distinguishing the truth of God from the
          thoughts that naturally arise in the prophet's own mind. Nor is
          there anything in Ezekiel's experience which necessarily goes
          beyond this conception; although the incident of the book has been
          interpreted in ways that burden him with a very crude and
          mechanical theory of inspiration. Some critics have believed that
          the book which he swallowed is the book he was afterwards to write,
          as if he had reproduced in instalments what was delivered to him at
          this time. Others, without going so far as this, find it at least
          significant that one who was to be pre-eminently a literary prophet
          should conceive of the word of the Lord as communicated to him in
          the form of a book. When one writer speaks of <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“eigenthümliche Empfindungen im Schlunde”</span><a id=
          "noteref_12" name="noteref_12" href="#note_12"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">12</span></span></a> as the
          basis of the figure, he seems to come perilously near to resolving
          inspiration into a nervous disease. All these representations go
          beyond a fair construction of the prophet's meaning. The act is
          purely symbolic. The book has nothing to do with the subject-matter
          of his prophecy, nor does the eating of it mean anything more than
          the self-surrender of the prophet to his vocation as a vehicle of
          the word of Jehovah. The idea that the word of God becomes a living
          power in the inner being of the prophet is also expressed by
          Jeremiah when he speaks of it as a <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page050">[pg 050]</span><a name="Pg050" id="Pg050" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“burning fire shut up
          in his bones”</span> (Jer. xx. 9); and Ezekiel's conception is
          similar. Although he speaks as if he had once for all assimilated
          the word of God, although he was conscious of a new power working
          within him, there is no proof that he thought of the word of the
          Lord as dwelling in him otherwise than as a spiritual impulse to
          utter the truth revealed to him from time to time. That is the
          inspiration which all the prophets possess: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Jehovah God hath spoken, who can but prophesy?”</span>
          (Amos iii. 8).</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">4. It was not to
          be expected that a prophet so practical in his aims as Ezekiel
          should be left altogether without some indication of the end to be
          accomplished by his work. The ordinary incentives to an arduous
          public career have indeed been denied to him. He knows that his
          mission contains no promise of a striking or an immediate success,
          that he will be misjudged and opposed by nearly all who hear him,
          and that he will have to pursue his course without appreciation or
          sympathy. It has been impressed on him that to declare God's
          message is an end in itself, a duty to be discharged with no regard
          to its issues, <span class="tei tei-q">“whether men hear or whether
          they forbear.”</span> Like Paul he recognises that <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“necessity is laid upon him”</span> to preach the word
          of God. But there is one word which reveals to him the way in which
          his ministry is to be made effective in the working out of
          Jehovah's purpose with Israel. <span class="tei tei-q">“Whether
          they hear or whether they forbear, they shall know that a prophet
          hath been among them”</span> (ii. 5). The reference is mainly to
          the destruction of the nation which Ezekiel well knew must form the
          chief burden of any true prophetic message delivered at that time.
          He will be approved as a prophet, and recognised as what he is,
          when his words are verified by the event. Does it seem a poor
          reward for years of incessant contention with prejudice and
          unbelief? It was at all events the only reward that was possible,
          but it was also to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page051">[pg
          051]</span><a name="Pg051" id="Pg051" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          be the beginning of better days. For these words have a wider
          significance than their bearing on the prophet's personal
          position.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It has been
          truly said that the preservation of the true religion after the
          downfall of the nation depended on the fact that the event had been
          clearly foretold. Two religions and two conceptions of God were
          then struggling for the mastery in Israel. One was the religion of
          the prophets, who set the moral holiness of Jehovah above every
          other consideration, and affirmed that His righteousness must be
          vindicated even at the cost of His people's destruction. The other
          was the popular religion which clung to the belief that Jehovah
          could not for any reason abandon His people without ceasing to be
          God. This conflict of principles reached its climax in the time of
          Ezekiel, and it also found its solution. The destruction of
          Jerusalem cleared the issues. It was then seen that the teaching of
          the prophets afforded the only possible explanation of the course
          of events. The Jehovah of the opposite religion was proved to be a
          figment of the popular imagination; and there was no alternative
          between accepting the prophetic interpretation of history and
          resigning all faith in the destiny of Israel. Hence the recognition
          of Ezekiel, the last of the old order of prophets, who had carried
          their threatenings on to the eve of their accomplishment, was
          really a great crisis of religion. It meant the triumph of the only
          conception of God on which the hope of a better future could be
          built. Although the people might still be far from the state of
          heart in which Jehovah could remove His chastening hand, the first
          condition of national repentance was given as soon as it was
          perceived that there had been prophets among them who had declared
          the purpose of Jehovah. The foundation was also laid for a more
          fruitful development of Ezekiel's activity. The word of the Lord
          had <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page052">[pg 052]</span><a name=
          "Pg052" id="Pg052" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> been in his hands a
          power <span class="tei tei-q">“to pluck up and to break down and to
          destroy”</span> the old Israel that would not know Jehovah;
          henceforward it was destined to <span class="tei tei-q">“build and
          plant”</span> a new Israel inspired by a new ideal of holiness and
          a whole-hearted repugnance to every form of idolatry.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">5. These then
          are the chief elements which enter into the remarkable experience
          that made Ezekiel a prophet. Further disclosures of the nature of
          his office were, however, necessary before he could translate his
          vocation into a conscious plan of work. The departure of the
          theophany appears to have left him in a state of mental
          prostration.<a id="noteref_13" name="noteref_13" href=
          "#note_13"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">13</span></span></a> In
          <span class="tei tei-q">“bitterness and heat of spirit”</span> he
          resumes his place amongst his fellow-captives at Tel-abib, and sits
          among them like a man bewildered for seven days. At the end of that
          time the effects of the ecstasy seem to pass away, and more light
          breaks on him with regard to his mission. He realises that it is to
          be largely a mission to individuals. He is appointed as a watchman
          to the house of Israel, to warn the wicked from his way; and as
          such he is held accountable for the fate of any soul that might
          miss the way of life through failure of duty on his part.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It has been
          supposed that this passage (ch. iii. 16-21) describes the character
          of a short period of public activity, in which Ezekiel endeavoured
          to act the part of a <span class="tei tei-q">“reprover”</span>
          (ver. 26) among the exiles. This is considered to have been his
          first attempt to act on his commission, and to have been continued
          until the prophet was convinced of its hopelessness and in
          obedience to the divine command shut himself up in his own house.
          But this view does not seem to be sufficiently borne out by the
          terms of the narrative. The words rather represent a point of view
          from which his whole ministry is surveyed, <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page053">[pg 053]</span><a name="Pg053" id="Pg053" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> or an aspect of it which possessed peculiar
          importance from the circumstances in which he was placed. The idea
          of his position as a watchman responsible for individuals may have
          been present to the prophet's mind from the time of his call; but
          the practical development of that idea was not possible until the
          destruction of Jerusalem had prepared men's minds to give heed to
          his admonitions. Accordingly the second period of Ezekiel's work
          opens with a fuller statement of the principles indicated in this
          section (ch. xxxiii.). We shall therefore defer the consideration
          of these principles till we reach the stage of the prophet's
          ministry at which their practical significance emerges.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">6. The last six
          verses of the third chapter may be regarded either as closing the
          account of Ezekiel's consecration or as the introduction to the
          first part of his ministry, that which preceded the fall of
          Jerusalem. They contain the description of a second trance, which
          appears to have happened seven days after the first. The prophet
          seemed to himself to be carried out in spirit to a certain plain
          near his residence in Tel-abib. There the glory of Jehovah appears
          to him precisely as he had seen it in his former vision by the
          river Kebar. He then receives the command to shut himself up within
          his house. He is to be like a man bound with ropes, unable to move
          about among his fellow-exiles. Moreover, the free use of speech is
          to be interdicted; his tongue will be made to cleave to his palate,
          so that he is as one <span class="tei tei-q">“dumb.”</span> But as
          often as he receives a message from Jehovah his mouth will be
          opened that he may declare it to the rebellious house of
          Israel.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now if we
          compare ver. 26 with xxiv. 27 and xxxiii. 22, we find that this
          state of intermittent dumbness continued till the day when the
          siege of Jerusalem began, and was not finally removed till tidings
          were brought of the capture <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page054">[pg 054]</span><a name="Pg054" id="Pg054" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> of the city. The verses before us therefore
          throw light on the prophet's demeanour during the first half of his
          ministry. What they signify is his almost entire withdrawal from
          public life. Instead of being like his great predecessors, a man
          living full in the public view, and thrusting himself on men's
          notice when they least desired him, he is to lead an isolated and a
          solitary life, a sign to the people rather than a living
          voice.<a id="noteref_14" name="noteref_14" href=
          "#note_14"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">14</span></span></a> From
          the sequel we gather that he excited sufficient interest to induce
          the elders and others to visit him in his house to inquire of
          Jehovah. We must also suppose that from time to time he emerged
          from his retirement with a message for the whole community. It
          cannot, indeed, be assumed that the chs. iv.-xxiv. contain an exact
          reproduction of the addresses delivered on these occasions. Few of
          them profess to have been uttered in public, and for the most part
          they give the impression of having been intended for patient study
          on the written page rather than for immediate oratorical effect.
          There is no reason to doubt that in the main they embody the
          results of Ezekiel's prophetic experiences during the period to
          which they are referred, although it may be impossible to determine
          how far they were actually spoken at the time, and how far they are
          merely written for the instruction of a wider audience.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The strong
          figures used here to describe this state of seclusion appear to
          reflect the prophet's consciousness of the restraints
          providentially imposed on the exercise of his office. These
          restraints, however, were moral, and not, as has sometimes been
          maintained, physical. The chief element was the pronounced
          hostility and incredulity of the people. This, combined with the
          sense of doom hanging over the nation, seems to have weighed
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page055">[pg 055]</span><a name=
          "Pg055" id="Pg055" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> on the spirit of
          Ezekiel, and in the ecstatic state the incubus lying upon him and
          paralysing his activity presents itself to his imagination as if he
          were bound with ropes and afflicted with dumbness. The
          representation finds a partial parallel in a later passage in the
          prophet's history. From ch. xxix. 21 (which is the latest prophecy
          in the whole book) we learn that the apparent non-fulfilment of his
          predictions against Tyre had caused a similar hindrance to his
          public work, depriving him of the boldness of speech characteristic
          of a prophet. And the opening of the mouth given to him on that
          occasion by the vindication of his words is clearly analogous to
          the removal of his silence by the news that Jerusalem had
          fallen.<a id="noteref_15" name="noteref_15" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With the fourth
          chapter we enter on the exposition of the first great division of
          Ezekiel's prophecies. The chs. iv.-xxiv. cover a period of about
          four and a half years, extending from the time of the prophet's
          call to the commencement of the siege of Jerusalem. During this
          time Ezekiel's thoughts revolved round one great theme—the
          approaching judgment on the city and the nation. Through
          contemplation of this fact there was disclosed to him the outline
          of a comprehensive theory of divine providence, in which the
          destruction of Israel was seen to be the necessary consequence of
          her past history and a necessary preliminary to her future
          restoration. The prophecies may be classified roughly under three
          heads. In the first class are those which exhibit the judgment
          itself in ways fitted to impress the prophet and his hearers with a
          conviction of its certainty; a second class is intended to demolish
          the illusions and false ideals which possessed the minds of the
          Israelites and made the announcement of disaster incredible; and a
          third and very important class expounds the moral principles which
          were illustrated by the judgment, and which show it to be a divine
          necessity. In the passage which forms the subject of the present
          lecture the bare fact and certainty of the judgment are set forth
          in word <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page060">[pg
          060]</span><a name="Pg060" id="Pg060" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          and symbol and with a minimum of commentary, although even here the
          conception which Ezekiel had formed of the moral situation is
          clearly discernible.</p>

          <div class="tei tei-div" style=
          "margin-bottom: 3.00em; margin-top: 3.00em">
            <h3 class="tei tei-head" style=

            <span style="font-size: 120%">I</span></h3>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The certainty
            of the national judgment seems to have been first impressed on
            Ezekiel's mind in the form of a singular series of symbolic acts
            which he conceived himself to be commanded to perform. The
            peculiarity of these signs is that they represent simultaneously
            two distinct aspects of the nation's fate—on the one hand the
            horrors of the siege of Jerusalem, and on the other hand the
            state of exile which was to follow.<a id="noteref_16" name=
            "noteref_16" href="#note_16"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">16</span></span></a></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That the
            destruction of Jerusalem should occupy the first place in the
            prophet's picture of national calamity requires no explanation.
            Jerusalem was the heart and brain of the nation, the centre of
            its life and its religion, and in the eyes of the prophets the
            fountain-head of its sin. The strength of her natural situation,
            the patriotic and religious associations which had gathered round
            her, and the smallness of her subject province gave to Jerusalem
            a unique position among the mother-cities of antiquity. And
            Ezekiel's hearers knew what he meant when he employed the picture
            of a beleaguered city to set forth the judgment that was to
            overtake them. That crowning horror of ancient warfare, the siege
            of a fortified town, meant in this case something more appalling
            to the imagination than the ravages of pestilence and famine and
            sword. The fate of Jerusalem represented the disappearance
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page061">[pg 061]</span><a name=
            "Pg061" id="Pg061" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of everything that
            had constituted the glory and excellence of Israel's national
            existence. That the light of Israel should be extinguished amidst
            the anguish and bloodshed which must accompany an unsuccessful
            defence of the capital was the most terrible element in Ezekiel's
            message, and here he sets it in the forefront of his
            prophecy.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The manner in
            which the prophet seeks to impress this fact on his countrymen
            illustrates a peculiar vein of realism which runs through all his
            thinking (ch. iv. 1-3). Being at a distance from Jerusalem, he
            seems to feel the need of some visible emblem of the doomed city
            before he can adequately represent the import of his prediction.
            He is commanded to take a brick and portray upon it a walled
            city, surrounded by the towers, mounds, and battering-rams which
            marked the usual operations of a besieging army. Then he is to
            erect a plate of iron between him and the city, and from behind
            this, with menacing gestures, he is as it were to press on the
            siege. The meaning of the symbols is obvious. As the engines of
            destruction appear on Ezekiel's diagram, at the bidding of
            Jehovah, so in due time the Chaldæan army will be seen from the
            walls of Jerusalem, led by the same unseen Power which now
            controls the acts of the prophet. In the last act Ezekiel
            exhibits the attitude of Jehovah Himself, cut off from His people
            by the iron wall of an inexorable purpose which no prayer could
            penetrate.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus far the
            prophet's actions, however strange they may appear to us, have
            been simple and intelligible. But at this point a second sign is
            as it were superimposed on the first, in order to symbolise an
            entirely different set of facts—the hardship and duration of the
            Exile (vv. 4-8). While still engaged in prosecuting the siege of
            the city, the prophet is supposed to become at the same time the
            representative of the guilty people and the victim <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page062">[pg 062]</span><a name="Pg062" id=
            "Pg062" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of the divine judgment. He is
            to <span class="tei tei-q">“bear their iniquity”</span>—that is,
            the punishment due to their sin. This is represented by his lying
            bound on his left side for a number of days equal to the years of
            Ephraim's banishment, and then on his right side for a time
            proportionate to the captivity of Judah. Now the time of Judah's
            exile is fixed at forty years, dating of course from the fall of
            the city. The captivity of North Israel exceeds that of Judah by
            the interval between the destruction of Samaria (722) and the
            fall of Jerusalem, a period which actually measured about a
            hundred and thirty-five years. In the Hebrew text, however, the
            length of Israel's captivity is given as three hundred and ninety
            years—that is, it must have lasted for three hundred and fifty
            years before that of Judah begins. This is obviously quite
            irreconcilable with the facts of history, and also with the
            prophet's intention. He cannot mean that the banishment of the
            northern tribes was to be protracted for two centuries after that
            of Judah had come to an end, for he uniformly speaks of the
            restoration of the two branches of the nation as simultaneous.
            The text of the Greek translation helps us past this difficulty.
            The Hebrew manuscript from which that version was made had the
            reading a <span class="tei tei-q">“hundred and ninety”</span>
            instead of <span class="tei tei-q">“three hundred and
            ninety”</span> in ver. 5. This alone yields a satisfactory sense,
            and the reading of the Septuagint is now generally accepted as
            representing what Ezekiel actually wrote. There is still a slight
            discrepancy between the hundred and thirty-five years of the
            actual history and the hundred and fifty years expressed by the
            symbol; but we must remember that Ezekiel is using round numbers
            throughout, and moreover he has not as yet fixed the precise date
            of the capture of Jerusalem when the last forty years are to
            commence.<a id="noteref_17" name="noteref_17" href=
            "#note_17"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the third
            symbol (vv. 9-17) the two aspects of the judgment are again
            presented in the closest possible combination. The prophet's food
            and drink during the days when he is imagined to be lying on his
            side represents on the one hand, by its being small in quantity
            and carefully weighed and measured, the rigours of famine in
            Jerusalem during the siege—<span class="tei tei-q">“Behold, I
            will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat
            bread by weight, and with anxiety; and drink water by measure,
            and with horror”</span> (ver. 16); on the other hand, by its
            mixed ingredients and by the fuel used in its preparation, it
            typifies the unclean religious condition of the people when in
            exile—<span class="tei tei-q">“Even so shall the children of
            Israel eat their food unclean among the heathen”</span> (ver.
            13). The meaning of this threat is best explained by a passage in
            the book of Hosea. Speaking of the Exile, Hosea says:
            <span class="tei tei-q">“They shall not remain in the land of
            Jehovah; but the children of Ephraim shall return to Egypt, and
            shall eat unclean food in Assyria. They shall pour out no wine to
            Jehovah, nor shall they lay out their sacrifices for Him: like
            the food of mourners shall their food be; all that eat thereof
            shall be defiled: for their bread shall only satisfy their
            hunger; it shall not come into the house of Jehovah”</span> (Hos.
            ix. 3, 4). The idea is that all food which has not been
            consecrated by being presented to Jehovah in the sanctuary is
            necessarily unclean, and those who eat of it contract ceremonial
            defilement. In the very act of satisfying his natural appetite a
            man forfeits his religious standing. This was the peculiar
            hardship of the state of exile, that a man must become unclean,
            he must eat unconsecrated food unless he renounced his religion
            and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page064">[pg 064]</span><a name=
            "Pg064" id="Pg064" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> served the gods of
            the land in which he dwelt. Between the time of Hosea and Ezekiel
            these ideas may have been somewhat modified by the introduction
            of the Deuteronomic law, which expressly permits secular
            slaughter at a distance from the sanctuary. But this did not
            lessen the importance of a legal sanctuary for the common life of
            an Israelite. The whole of a man's flocks and herds, the whole
            produce of his fields, had to be sanctified by the presentation
            of firstlings and firstfruits at the Temple before he could enjoy
            the reward of his industry with the sense of standing in
            Jehovah's favour. Hence the destruction of the sanctuary or the
            permanent exclusion of the worshippers from it reduced the whole
            life of the people to a condition of uncleanness which was felt
            to be as great a calamity as was a papal interdict in the Middle
            Ages. This is the fact which is expressed in the part of
            Ezekiel's symbolism now before us. What it meant for his
            fellow-exiles was that the religious disability under which they
            laboured was to be continued for a generation. The whole life of
            Israel was to become unclean until its inward state was made
            worthy of the religious privileges now to be withdrawn. At the
            same time no one could have felt the penalty more severely than
            Ezekiel himself, in whom habits of ceremonial purity had become a
            second nature. The repugnance which he feels at the loathsome
            manner in which he was at first directed to prepare his food, and
            the profession of his own practice in exile, as well as the
            concession made to his scrupulous sense of propriety (vv. 14-16),
            are all characteristic of one whose priestly training had made a
            defect of ceremonial cleanness almost equivalent to a moral
            delinquency.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The last of
            the symbols (ch. v. 1-4) represents the fate of the population of
            Jerusalem when the city is taken. The shaving of the prophet's
            head and beard is a figure for the depopulation of the city and
            country. By a further <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page065">[pg
            065]</span><a name="Pg065" id="Pg065" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            series of acts, whose meaning is obvious, he shows how a third of
            the inhabitants shall die of famine and pestilence during the
            siege, a third shall be slain by the enemy when the city is
            captured, while the remaining third shall be dispersed among the
            nations. Even these shall be pursued by the sword of vengeance
            until but a few numbered individuals survive, and of them again a
            part passes through the fire. The passage reminds us of the last
            verse of the sixth chapter of Isaiah, which was perhaps in
            Ezekiel's mind when he wrote: <span class="tei tei-q">“And if a
            tenth still remain in it [the land], it shall again pass through
            the fire: as a terebinth or an oak whose stump is left at their
            felling: a holy seed shall be the stock thereof”</span> (Isa. vi.
            13). At least the conception of a succession of sifting
            judgments, leaving only a remnant to inherit the promise of the
            future, is common to both prophets, and the symbol in Ezekiel is
            noteworthy as the first expression of his steadfast conviction
            that further punishments were in store for the exiles after the
            destruction of Jerusalem.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is clear
            that these signs could never have been enacted, either in view of
            the people or in solitude, as they are here described. It may be
            doubted whether the whole description is not purely ideal,
            representing a process which passed through the prophet's mind,
            or was suggested to him in the visionary state but never actually
            performed. That will always remain a tenable view. An imaginary
            symbolic act is as legitimate a literary device as an imaginary
            conversation. It is absurd to mix up the question of the
            prophet's truthfulness with the question whether he did or did
            not actually do what he conceives himself as doing. The attempt
            to explain his action by catalepsy would take us but a little
            way, even if the arguments adduced in favour of it were stronger
            than they are. Since even a cataleptic patient could not
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page066">[pg 066]</span><a name=
            "Pg066" id="Pg066" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> have tied himself
            down on his side or prepared and eaten his food in that posture,
            it is necessary in any case to admit that there must be a
            considerable, though indeterminate, element of literary
            imagination in the account given of the symbols. It is not
            impossible that some symbolic representation of the siege of
            Jerusalem may have actually been the first act in Ezekiel's
            ministry. In the interpretation of the vision which immediately
            follows we shall find that no notice is taken of the features
            which refer to exile, but only of those which announce the siege
            of Jerusalem. It may therefore be the case that Ezekiel did some
            such action as is here described, pointing to the fall of
            Jerusalem, but that the whole was taken up afterwards in his
            imagination and made into an ideal representation of the two
            great facts which formed the burden of his earlier prophecy.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is a relief
            to turn from this somewhat fantastic, though for its own purpose
            effective, exhibition of prophetic ideas to the impassioned
            oracles in which the doom of the city and the nation is
            pronounced. The first of these (ch. v. 5-17) is introduced here
            as the explanation of the signs that have been described, in so
            far as they bear on the fate of Jerusalem; but it has a unity of
            its own, and is a characteristic specimen of Ezekiel's oratorical
            style. It consists of two parts: the first (vv. 5-10) deals
            chiefly with the reasons for the judgment on Jerusalem, and the
            second (vv. 11-17) with the nature of the judgment itself. The
            chief thought of the passage is the unexampled severity of the
            punishment which is in store for Israel, as represented by the
            fate of the capital. A calamity so unprecedented demands an
            explanation as unique as itself. Ezekiel finds the ground of it
            in the signal honour conferred on Jerusalem in her being set in
            the midst of the nations, in the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page067">[pg 067]</span><a name="Pg067" id="Pg067" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> possession of a religion which expressed
            the will of the one God, and in the fact that she had proved
            herself unworthy of her distinction and privileges and tried to
            live as the nations around. <span class="tei tei-q">“This is
            Jerusalem which I have set in the midst of the nations, with the
            lands round about her. But she rebelled against My judgments
            wickedly<a id="noteref_18" name="noteref_18" href=
            "#note_18"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">18</span></span></a> more
            than the nations, and My statutes more than [other] lands round
            about her: for they rejected My judgments, and in My statutes
            they did not walk.... Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah:
            Behold, even I am against you; and I will execute in thy midst
            judgments before the nations, and will do in thy case what I have
            not done [heretofore], and what I shall not do the like of any
            more, according to all thy abominations”</span> (vv. 5-9). The
            central position of Jerusalem is evidently no figure of speech in
            the mouth of Ezekiel. It means that she is so situated as to
            fulfil her destiny in the view of all the nations of the world,
            who can read in her wonderful history the character of the God
            who is above all gods. Nor can the prophet be fairly accused of
            provincialism in thus speaking of Jerusalem's unrivalled physical
            and moral advantages. The mountain ridge on which she stood lay
            almost across the great highways of communication between the
            East and the West, between the hoary seats of civilisation and
            the lands whither the course of empire took its way. Ezekiel knew
            that Tyre was the centre of the old world's commerce,<a id=
            "noteref_19" name="noteref_19" href="#note_19"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">19</span></span></a> but
            he also knew that Jerusalem occupied a central situation in the
            civilised world, and in that fact he rightly saw a providential
            mark of the grandeur and universality of her religious mission.
            Her calamities, too, were probably such as no other city
            experienced. The terrible prediction of ver. 10, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Fathers shall eat sons in <span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page068">[pg 068]</span><a name="Pg068" id="Pg068" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> the midst of thee, and sons shall eat
            fathers,”</span> seems to have been literally fulfilled.
            <span class="tei tei-q">“The hands of the pitiful women have
            sodden their own children: they were their meat in the
            destruction of the daughter of My people”</span> (Lam. iv. 10).
            It is likely enough that the annals of Assyrian conquest cover
            many a tale of woe which in point of mere physical suffering
            paralleled the atrocities of the siege of Jerusalem. But no other
            nation had a conscience so sensitive as Israel, or lost so much
            by its political annihilation. The humanising influences of a
            pure religion had made Israel susceptible of a kind of anguish
            which ruder communities were spared.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sin of
            Jerusalem is represented after Ezekiel's manner as on the one
            hand transgression of the divine commandments, and on the other
            defilement of the Temple through false worship. These are ideas
            which we shall frequently meet in the course of the book, and
            they need not detain us here. The prophet proceeds (vv. 11-17) to
            describe in detail the relentless punishment which the divine
            vengeance is to inflict on the inhabitants and the city. The
            jealousy, the wrath, the indignation of Jehovah, which are
            represented as <span class="tei tei-q">“satisfied”</span> by the
            complete destruction of the people, belong to the limitations of
            the conception of God which Ezekiel had. It was impossible at
            that time to interpret such an event as the fall of Jerusalem in
            a religious sense otherwise than as a vehement outburst of
            Jehovah's anger, expressing the reaction of His holy nature
            against the sin of idolatry. There is indeed a great distance
            between the attitude of Ezekiel towards the hapless city and the
            yearning pity of Christ's lament over the sinful Jerusalem of His
            time. Yet the first was a step towards the second. Ezekiel
            realised intensely that part of God's character which it was
            needful to enforce in order to beget in his countrymen the deep
            horror at the sin of idolatry which characterised the later
            Judaism. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page069">[pg
            069]</span><a name="Pg069" id="Pg069" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            The best commentary on the latter part of this chapter is found
            in those parts of the book of Lamentations which speak of the
            state of the city and the survivors after its overthrow. There we
            see how quickly the stern judgment produced a more chastened and
            beautiful type of piety than had ever been prevalent before.
            Those pathetic utterances, in which patriotism and religion are
            so finely blended, are like the timid and tentative advances of a
            child's heart towards a parent who has ceased to punish but has
            not begun to caress. This and much else that is true and
            ennobling in the later religion of Israel is rooted in the
            terrifying sense of the divine anger against sin so powerfully
            represented in the preaching of Ezekiel.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next two
            chapters may be regarded as pendants to the theme which is dealt
            with in this opening section of the book of Ezekiel. In the
            fourth and fifth chapters the prophet had mainly the city in his
            eye as the focus of the nation's life; in the sixth he turns his
            eye to the land which had shared the sin, and must suffer the
            punishment, of the capital. It is, in its first part (vv. 2-10),
            an apostrophe to the mountain land of Israel, which seems to
            stand out before the exile's mind with its mountains and hills,
            its ravines and valleys, in contrast to the monotonous plain of
            Babylonia which stretched around him. But these mountains were
            familiar to the prophet as the seats of the rural idolatry in
            Israel. The word <span lang="he" class="tei tei-foreign"
            xml:lang="he"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">bāmah</span></span>, which means properly
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the height,”</span> had come to be used
            as the name of an idolatrous sanctuary. These sanctuaries were
            probably Canaanitish in origin; and although by Israel they had
            been consecrated to the worship of Jehovah, yet He was worshipped
            there in ways which the prophets pronounced hateful to Him. They
            had been destroyed by Josiah, but <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page070">[pg 070]</span><a name="Pg070" id="Pg070" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> must have been restored to their former use
            during the revival of heathenism which followed his death. It is
            a lurid picture which rises before the prophet's imagination as
            he contemplates the judgment of this provincial idolatry: the
            altars laid waste, the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“sun-pillars”</span><a id="noteref_20" name=
            "noteref_20" href="#note_20"><span class=

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">20</span></span></a>
            broken, and the idols surrounded by the corpses of men who had
            fled to their shrines for protection and perished at their feet.
            This demonstration of the helplessness of the rustic divinities
            to save their sanctuaries and their worshippers will be the means
            of breaking the rebellious heart and the whorish eyes that had
            led Israel so far astray from her true Lord, and will produce in
            exile the self-loathing which Ezekiel always regards as the
            beginning of penitence.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the
            prophet's passion rises to a higher pitch, and he hears the
            command <span class="tei tei-q">“Clap thy hands, and stamp with
            thy foot, and say, Aha for the abominations of the house of
            Israel!”</span> These are gestures and exclamations, not of
            indignation, but of contempt and triumphant scorn. The same
            feeling and even the same gestures are ascribed to Jehovah
            Himself in another passage of highly charged emotion (ch. xxi.
            17). And it is only fair to remember that it is the anticipation
            of the victory of Jehovah's cause that fills the mind of the
            prophet at such moments and seems to deaden the sense of human
            sympathy within him. At the same time the victory of Jehovah was
            the victory of prophecy, and in so far Smend may be right in
            regarding the words as throwing light on the intensity of the
            antagonism in which prophecy and the popular religion then stood.
            The devastation of the land is to be effected by the same
            instruments as were at work in the destruction <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page071">[pg 071]</span><a name="Pg071" id=
            "Pg071" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of the city: first the sword
            of the Chaldæans, then famine and pestilence among those who
            escape, until the whole of Israel's ancient territory lies
            desolate from the southern steppes to Riblah in the north.<a id=
            "noteref_21" name="noteref_21" href="#note_21"><span class=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Ch. vii. is
            one of those singled out by Ewald as preserving most faithfully
            the spirit and language of Ezekiel's earlier utterances. Both in
            thought and expression it exhibits a freedom and animation seldom
            attained in Ezekiel's writings, and it is evident that it must
            have been composed under keen emotion. It is comparatively free
            from those stereotyped phrases which are elsewhere so common, and
            the style falls at times into the rhythm which is characteristic
            of Hebrew poetry. Ezekiel hardly perhaps attains to perfect
            mastery of poetic form, and even here we may be sensible of a
            lack of power to blend a series of impressions and images into an
            artistic unity. The vehemence of his feeling hurries him from one
            conception to another, without giving full expression to any, or
            indicating clearly the connection that leads from one to the
            other. This circumstance, and the corrupt condition of the text
            together, make the chapter in some parts unintelligible, and as a
            whole one of the most difficult in the book. In its present
            position it forms a fitting conclusion to the opening section of
            the book. All the elements of the judgment which have just been
            foretold are gathered up in one outburst of emotion, producing a
            song of triumph in which the prophet seems to stand in the uproar
            of the final catastrophe and exult amid the crash and wreck of
            the old order which is passing away.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The passage is
            divided into five stanzas, which may originally have been
            approximately equal in length, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

            long as any of the others.<a id="noteref_22" name="noteref_22"

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">i. Vv.
            2-9.—The first verse strikes the keynote of the whole poem; it is
            the inevitableness and the finality of the approaching
            dissolution. A striking phrase of Amos<a id="noteref_23" name=
            "noteref_23" href="#note_23"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">23</span></span></a> is
            first taken up and expanded in accordance with the anticipations
            with which the previous chapters have now familiarised us:
            <span class="tei tei-q">“An end is come, the end is come on the
            four skirts of the land.”</span> The poet already hears the
            tumult and confusion of the battle; the vintage songs of the
            Judæan peasant are silenced, and with the din and fury of war the
            day of the Lord draws near.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">ii. Vv.
            10-13.—The prophet's thoughts here revert to the present, and he
            notes the eager interest with which men both in Judah and Babylon
            are pursuing the ordinary business of life and the vain dreams of
            political greatness. <span class="tei tei-q">“The diadem
            flourishes, the sceptre blossoms, arrogance shoots up.”</span>
            These expressions must refer to the efforts of the new rulers of
            Jerusalem to restore the fortunes of the nation and the glories
            of the old kingdom which had been so greatly tarnished by the
            recent captivity. Things are going bravely, they think; they are
            surprised at their own success; they hope that the day of small
            things will grow into the day of things greater than those which
            are past. The following verse is untranslatable; probably the
            original words, if we could recover them, would contain some
            pointed and scornful antithesis to these futile and vain-glorious
            anticipations. The allusion to <span class="tei tei-q">“buyers
            and sellers”</span> (ver. 12) may possibly be quite general,
            referring only to the absorbing interest which men continue to
            take in their possessions, heedless of the impending
            judgment.<a id="noteref_24" name="noteref_24" href=
            "#note_24"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">24</span></span></a> But
            the facts that the advantage is assumed <span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page073">[pg 073]</span><a name="Pg073" id="Pg073" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> to be on the side of the buyer and that the
            seller expects to return to his heritage make it probable that
            the prophet is thinking of the forced sales by the expatriated
            nobles of their estates in Palestine, and to their deeply
            cherished resolve to right themselves when the time of their
            exile is over. All such ambitions, says the prophet, are
            vain—<span class="tei tei-q">“the seller shall not return to what
            he sold, and a man shall not by wrong preserve his
            living.”</span> In any case Ezekiel evinces here, as elsewhere, a
            certain sympathy with the exiled aristocracy, in opposition to
            the pretensions of the new men who had succeeded to their
            honours.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">iii. Vv.
            14-18.—The next scene that rises before the prophet's vision is
            the collapse of Judah's military preparations in the hour of
            danger. Their army exists but on paper. There is much blowing of
            trumpets and much organising, but no men to go forth to battle. A
            blight rests on all their efforts; their hands are paralysed and
            their hearts unnerved by the sense that <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“wrath rests on all their pomp.”</span> Sword,
            famine, and pestilence, the ministers of Jehovah's vengeance,
            shall devour the inhabitants of the city and the country, until
            but a few survivors on the tops of the mountains remain to mourn
            over the universal desolation.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">iv. Vv.
            19-22.—At present the inhabitants of Jerusalem are proud of the
            ill-gotten and ill-used wealth stored up within her, and
            doubtless the exiles cast covetous eyes on the luxury which may
            still have prevailed amongst the upper classes in the capital.
            But of what avail will all this treasure be in the evil day now
            so near at hand? It will but add mockery to their sufferings to
            be surrounded by gold and silver which can do nothing to allay
            the pangs of hunger. It will be cast in the streets as refuse,
            for it cannot save them in the day of Jehovah's anger. Nay, more,
            it will become the prize of the most <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page074">[pg 074]</span><a name="Pg074" id="Pg074" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> ruthless of the heathen (the Chaldæans);
            and when in the eagerness of their lust for gold they ransack the
            Temple treasury and so desecrate the Holy Place, Jehovah will
            avert His face and suffer them to work their will. The curse of
            Jehovah rests on the silver and gold of Jerusalem, which has been
            used for the making of idolatrous images, and now is made to them
            an unclean thing.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">v. Vv.
            23-27.—The closing strophe contains a powerful description of the
            dismay and despair that will seize all classes in the state as
            the day of wrath draws near. Calamity after calamity comes,
            rumour follows hard on rumour, and the heads of the nation are
            distracted and cease to exercise the functions of leadership. The
            recognised guides of the people—the prophets, the priests, and
            the wise men—have no word of counsel or direction to offer; the
            prophet's vision, the priest's traditional lore, and the wise
            man's sagacity are alike at fault. So the king and the grandees
            are filled with stupefaction; and the common people, deprived of
            their natural leaders, sit down in helpless dejection. Thus shall
            Jerusalem be recompensed according to her doings. <span class=

            violence”</span>; and in the correspondence between desert and

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It may be
            useful at this point to note certain theological principles which
            already begin to appear in this earliest of Ezekiel's prophecies.
            Reflection on the nature and purpose of the divine dealings we
            have seen to be a characteristic of his work; and even those
            passages which we have considered, although chiefly devoted to an
            enforcement of the fact of judgment, present some features
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page075">[pg 075]</span><a name=
            "Pg075" id="Pg075" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of the conception
            of Israel's history which had been formed in his mind.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">1. We observe
            in the first place that the prophet lays great stress on the
            world-wide significance of the events which are to befall Israel.
            This thought is not as yet developed, but it is clearly present.
            The relation between Jehovah and Israel is so peculiar that He is
            known to the nations in the first instance only as Israel's God,
            and thus His being and character have to be learned from His
            dealings with His own people. And since Jehovah is the only true
            God and must be worshipped as such everywhere, the history of
            Israel has an interest for the world such as that of no other
            nation has. She was placed in the centre of the nations in order
            that the knowledge of God might radiate from her through all the
            world; and now that she has proved unfaithful to her mission,
            Jehovah must manifest His power and His character by an
            unexampled work of judgment. Even the destruction of Israel is a
            demonstration to the universal conscience of mankind of what true
            divinity is.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">2. But the
            judgment has of course a purpose and a meaning for Israel
            herself, and both purposes are summed up in the recurring formula
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Ye [they] shall know that I am
            Jehovah,”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“that I, Jehovah,
            have spoken.”</span> These two phrases express precisely the same
            idea, although from slightly different starting-points. It is
            assumed that Jehovah's personality is to be identified by His
            word spoken through the prophets. He is known to men through the
            revelation of Himself in the prophets' utterances. <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Ye shall know that I, Jehovah, have spoken”</span>
            means therefore, Ye shall know that it is I, the God of Israel
            and the Ruler of the universe, who speak these things. In other
            words, the harmony between prophecy and providence guarantees the
            source of the prophet's message. The shorter phrase <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Ye shall know that I am <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page076">[pg 076]</span><a name="Pg076" id="Pg076" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> Jehovah”</span> may mean Ye shall know that
            I who now speak am truly Jehovah, the God of Israel. The
            prejudices of the people would have led them to deny that the
            power which dictated Ezekiel's prophecy could be their God; but
            this denial, together with the false idea of Jehovah on which it
            rests, shall be destroyed for ever when the prophet's words come
            true.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is of
            course no doubt that Ezekiel conceived Jehovah as endowed with
            the plenitude of deity, or that in his view the name expressed
            all that we mean by the word God. Nevertheless, historically the
            name Jehovah is a proper name, denoting the God who is the God of
            Israel. Renan has ventured on the assertion that a deity with a
            proper name is necessarily a false god. The statement perhaps
            measures the difference between the God of revealed religion and
            the god who is an abstraction, an expression of the order of the
            universe, who exists only in the mind of the man who names him.
            The God of revelation is a living person, with a character and
            will of His own, capable of being known by man. It is the
            distinction of revelation that it dares to regard God as an
            individual with an inner life and nature of His own, independent
            of the conception men may form of Him. Applied to such a Being, a
            personal name may be as true and significant as the name which
            expresses the character and individuality of a man. Only thus can
            we understand the historical process by which the God who was
            first manifested as the deity of a particular nation preserves
            His personal identity with the God who in Christ is at last
            revealed as the God of the spirits of all flesh. The knowledge of
            Jehovah of which Ezekiel speaks is therefore at once a knowledge
            of the character of the God whom Israel professed to serve, and a
            knowledge of that which constitutes true and essential
            divinity.<a id="noteref_25" name="noteref_25" href=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">3. The
            prophet, in ch. vi. 8-10, proceeds one step further in
            delineating the effect of the judgment on the minds of the
            survivors. The fascination of idolatry for the Israelites is
            conceived as produced by that radical perversion of the religious
            sense which the prophets call <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“whoredom”</span>—a sensuous delight in the blessings
            of nature, and an indifference to the moral element which can
            alone preserve either religion or human love from corruption. The
            spell shall at last be broken in the new knowledge of Jehovah
            which is produced by calamity; and the heart of the people,
            purified from its delusions, shall turn to Him who has smitten
            them, as the only true God. <span class="tei tei-q">“When your
            fugitives from the sword are among the nations, when they are
            scattered through the lands, then shall your fugitives remember

            when I break their heart that goes awhoring from Me, and their
            whorish eyes which went after their idols.”</span> When the
            idolatrous propensity is thus eradicated, the conscience of
            Israel will turn inwards on itself, and in the light of its new
            knowledge of God will for the first time read its own history
            aright. The beginnings of a new spiritual life will be made in
            the bitter self-condemnation which is one side of the national
            repentance. <span class="tei tei-q">“They shall loathe themselves
            for all the evil that they have committed in all their

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One of the most
          instructive phases of religious belief among the Israelites of the
          seventh century was the superstitious regard in which the Temple at
          Jerusalem was held. Its prestige as the metropolitan sanctuary had
          no doubt steadily increased from the time when it was built. But it
          was in the crisis of the Assyrian invasion that the popular
          sentiment in favour of its peculiar sanctity was transmuted into a
          fanatical faith in its inherent inviolability. It is well known
          that during the whole course of this invasion the prophet Isaiah
          had consistently taught that the enemy should never set foot within
          the precincts of the Holy City—that, on the contrary, the attempt
          to seize it would prove to be the signal for his annihilation. The
          striking fulfilment of this prediction in the sudden destruction of
          Sennacherib's army had an immense effect on the religion of the
          time. It restored the faith in Jehovah's omnipotence which was
          already giving way, and it granted a new lease of life to the very
          errors which it ought to have extinguished. For here, as in so many
          other cases, what was a spiritual faith in one generation became a
          superstition in the next. Indifferent to the divine truths which
          gave meaning to Isaiah's prophecy, the people changed his sublime
          faith in the living God working in history into a crass confidence
          in the material symbol which had been the means of expressing
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page079">[pg 079]</span><a name=
          "Pg079" id="Pg079" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> it to their minds.
          Henceforth it became a fundamental tenet of the current creed that
          the Temple and the city which guarded it could never fall into the
          hands of an enemy; and any teaching which assailed that belief was
          felt to undermine confidence in the national deity. In the time of
          Jeremiah and Ezekiel this superstition existed in unabated vigour,
          and formed one of the greatest hindrances to the acceptance of
          their teaching. <span class="tei tei-q">“The Temple of the Lord,
          the Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord are these!”</span>
          was the cry of the benighted worshippers as they thronged to its
          courts to seek the favour of Jehovah (Jer. vii. 4). The same state
          of feeling must have prevailed among Ezekiel's fellow-exiles. To
          the prophet himself, attached as he was to the worship of the
          Temple, it may have been a thought almost too hard to bear that
          Jehovah should abandon the only place of His legitimate worship.
          Amongst the rest of the captives the faith in its infallibility was
          one of the illusions which must be overthrown before their minds
          could perceive the true drift of his teaching. In his first
          prophecy the fact had just been touched on, but merely as an
          incident in the fall of Jerusalem. About a year later, however, he
          received a new revelation, in which he learned that the destruction
          of the Temple was no mere incidental consequence of the capture of
          the city, but a main object of the calamity. The time was come when
          judgment must begin at the house of God.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The weird vision
          in which this truth was conveyed to the prophet is said to have
          occurred during a visit of the elders to Ezekiel in his own house.
          In their presence he fell into a trance, in which the events now to
          be considered passed before him; and after the trance was removed
          he recounted the substance of the vision to the exiles. This
          statement has been somewhat needlessly called in question, on the
          ground that after so protracted an ecstasy the <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page080">[pg 080]</span><a name="Pg080" id="Pg080"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> prophet would not be likely to find his
          visitors still in their places. But this matter-of-fact criticism
          overreaches itself. We have no means of determining how long it
          would take for this series of events to be realised. If we may
          trust anything to the analogy of dreams—and of all conditions to
          which ordinary men are subject the dream is surely the closest
          analogy to the prophetic ecstasy—the whole may have passed in an
          incredibly short space of time. If the statement were untrue, it is
          difficult to see what Ezekiel would have gained by making it. If
          the whole vision were a fiction, this must of course be fictitious
          too; but even so it seems a very superfluous piece of
          invention.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We prefer,
          therefore, to regard the vision as real, and the assigned situation
          as historical; and the fact that it is recorded suggests that there
          must be some connection between the object of the visit and the
          burden of the revelation which was then communicated. It is not
          difficult to imagine points of contact between them. Ewald has
          conjectured that the occasion of the visit may have been some
          recent tidings from Jerusalem which had opened the eyes of the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“elders”</span> to the real relation that
          existed between them and their brethren at home. If they had ever
          cherished any illusions on the point, they had certainly been
          disabused of them before Ezekiel had this vision. They were aware,
          whether the information was recent or not, that they were
          absolutely disowned by the new authorities in Jerusalem, and that
          it was impossible that they should ever come back peaceably to
          their old place in the state. This created a problem which they
          could not solve, and the fact that Ezekiel had announced the fall
          of Jerusalem may have formed a bond of sympathy between him and his
          brethren in exile which drew them to him in their perplexity. Some
          such hypothesis gives at all events a fuller significance to the
          closing <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page081">[pg
          081]</span><a name="Pg081" id="Pg081" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          part of the vision, where the attitude of the men in Jerusalem is
          described, and where the exiles are taught that the hope of
          Israel's future lies with them. It is the first time that Ezekiel
          has distinguished between the fates in store for the two sections
          of the people, and it would almost appear as if the promotion of
          the exiles to the first place in the true Israel was a new
          revelation to him. Twice during this vision he is moved to
          intercede for the <span class="tei tei-q">“remnant of
          Israel,”</span> as if the only hope of a new people of God lay in
          sparing at least some of those who were left in the land. But the
          burden of the message that now comes to him is that in the
          spiritual sense the true remnant of Israel is not in Judæa, but
          among the exiles in Babylon. It was there that the new Israel was
          to be formed, and the land was to be the heritage, not of those who
          clung to it and exulted in the misfortunes of their banished
          brethren, but of those who under the discipline of exile were first
          prepared to use the land as Jehovah's holiness demanded.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The vision is
          interesting, in the first place, on account of the glimpse it
          affords of the state of mind prevailing in influential circles in
          Jerusalem at this time. There is no reason whatever to doubt that
          here in the form of a vision we have reliable information regarding
          the actual state of matters when Ezekiel wrote. It has been
          supposed by some critics that the description of the idolatries in
          the Temple does not refer to contemporary practices, but to abuses
          that had been rife in the days of Manasseh and had been put a stop
          to by Josiah's reformation. But the vision loses half its meaning
          if it is taken as merely an idealised representation of all the
          sins that had polluted the Temple in the course of its history. The
          names of those who are seen must be names of living men known to
          Ezekiel and his contemporaries, and the sentiments put in their
          mouth, especially in the latter part of the vision, <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page082">[pg 082]</span><a name="Pg082" id="Pg082"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> are suitable only to the age in which
          he lived. It is very probable that the description in its general
          features would <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">also</span></em> apply to the days of
          Manasseh; but the revival of idolatry which followed the death of
          Josiah would naturally take the form of a restoration of the
          illegal cults which had flourished unchecked under his grandfather.
          Ezekiel's own experience before his captivity, and the steady
          intercourse which had been maintained since, would supply him with
          the material which in the ecstatic condition is wrought up into
          this powerful picture.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The thing that
          surprises us most is the prevailing conviction amongst the ruling
          classes that <span class="tei tei-q">“Jehovah had forsaken the
          land.”</span> These men seem to have partly emancipated themselves,
          as politicians in Israel were apt to do, from the restraints and
          narrowness of the popular religion. To them it was a conceivable
          thing that Jehovah should abandon His people. And yet life was
          worth living and fighting for apart from Jehovah. It was of course
          a merely selfish life, not inspired by national ideals, but simply
          a clinging to place and power. The wish was father to the thought;
          men who so readily yielded to the belief in Jehovah's absence were
          very willing to be persuaded of its truth. The religion of Jehovah
          had always imposed a check on social and civic wrong, and men whose
          power rested on violence and oppression could not but rejoice to be
          rid of it. So they seem to have acquiesced readily enough in the
          conclusion to which so many circumstances seemed to point, that
          Jehovah had ceased to interest Himself either for good or evil in
          them and their affairs. Still, the wide acceptance of a belief like
          this, so repugnant to all the religious ideas of the ancient world,
          seems to require for its explanation some fact of contemporary
          history. It has been thought that it arose from the disappearance
          of the ark of Jehovah from the Temple. It seems from the third
          chapter of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page083">[pg
          083]</span><a name="Pg083" id="Pg083" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          Jeremiah that the ark was no longer in existence in Josiah's reign,
          and that the want of it was felt as a grave religious loss. It is
          not improbable that this circumstance, in connection with the
          disasters which had marked the last days of the kingdom, led in
          many minds to the fear and in some to the hope that along with His
          most venerable symbol Jehovah Himself had vanished from their
          midst.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It should be
          noticed that the feeling described was only one of several currents
          that ran in the divided society of Jerusalem. It is quite a
          different point of view that is presented in the taunt quoted in
          ch. xi. 15, that the exiles were far from Jehovah, and had
          therefore lost their right to their possessions. But the religious
          despair is not only the most startling fact that we have to look
          at; it is also the one that is made most prominent in the vision.
          And the divine answer to it given through Ezekiel is that the
          conviction is true; Jehovah <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">has</span></em> forsaken the land. But in the
          first place the cause of His departure is found in those very
          practices for which it was made the excuse; and in the second,
          although He has ceased to dwell in the midst of His people, He has
          lost neither the power nor the will to punish their iniquities. To
          impress these truths first on his fellow-exiles and then on the
          whole nation is the chief object of the chapter before us.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now we find that
          the general sense of God-forsakenness expressed itself principally
          in two directions. On the one hand it led to the multiplication of
          false objects of worship to supply the place of Him who was
          regarded as the proper tutelary Divinity of Israel; on the other
          hand it produced a reckless, devil-may-care spirit of resistance
          against any odds, such as was natural to men who had only material
          interests to fight for, and nothing to trust in but their own right
          hand. Syncretism in religion and fatalism in politics—these were
          the twin symptoms <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page084">[pg
          084]</span><a name="Pg084" id="Pg084" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          of the decay of faith among the upper classes in Jerusalem. But
          these belong to two different parts of the vision which we must now
          distinguish.</p>

          <div class="tei tei-div" style=
          "margin-top: 3.00em; margin-bottom: 3.00em">
            <h3 class="tei tei-head" style=
            "text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2.40em; margin-top: 2.40em">
            <span style="font-size: 120%">I</span></h3>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first part
            deals with the departure of Jehovah as caused by religious
            offences perpetrated in the Temple, and with the return of
            Jehovah to destroy the city on account of these offences. The
            prophet is transported in <span class="tei tei-q">“visions of
            God”</span> to Jerusalem, and placed in the outer court near the
            northern gate, outside of which was the site where the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“image of Jealousy”</span> had stood in
            the time of Manasseh. Near him stands the appearance which he had
            learned to recognise as the glory of Jehovah, signifying that
            Jehovah has, for a purpose not yet disclosed, revisited His
            Temple. But first Ezekiel must be made to see the state of things
            which exists in this Temple which had once been the seat of God's
            presence. Looking through the gate to the north, he discovers
            that the image of Jealousy<a id="noteref_26" name="noteref_26"
            href="#note_26"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">26</span></span></a> has
            been restored to its old place. This is the first and apparently
            the least heinous of the abominations that defiled the
            sanctuary.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The second
            scene is the only one of the four which represents a secret cult.
            Partly perhaps for that reason it strikes our minds as the most
            repulsive of all; but that was obviously not Ezekiel's estimate
            of it. There are greater abominations to follow. It is difficult
            to understand the particulars of Ezekiel's description,
            especially <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page085">[pg
            085]</span><a name="Pg085" id="Pg085" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            in the Hebrew text (the LXX. is simpler); but it seems impossible
            to escape the impression that there was something obscene in a
            worship where idolatry appears as ashamed of itself. The
            essential fact, however, is that the very highest and most
            influential men in the land were addicted to a form of
            heathenism, whose objects of worship were pictures of
            <span class="tei tei-q">“horrid creeping things, and cattle, and
            all the gods of the house of Israel.”</span> The name of one of
            these men, the leader in this superstition, is given, and is
            significant of the state of life in Jerusalem shortly before its
            fall. Jaazaniah was the son of Shaphan, who is probably identical
            with the chancellor of Josiah's reign whose sympathy with the
            prophetic teaching was evinced by his zeal in the cause of
            reform. We read of other members of the family who were faithful
            to the national religion, such as his son Ahikam, also a zealous
            reformer, and his grandson Gedaliah, Jeremiah's friend and
            patron, and the governor appointed over Judah by Nebuchadnezzar
            after the taking of the city. The family was thus divided both in
            religion and politics. While one branch was devoted to the
            worship of Jehovah and favoured submission to the king of
            Babylon, Jaazaniah belonged to the opposite party and was the
            ringleader in a peculiarly obnoxious form of idolatry.<a id=
            "noteref_27" name="noteref_27" href="#note_27"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">27</span></span></a></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The third
            <span class="tei tei-q">“abomination”</span> is a form of
            idolatry widely diffused over Western Asia—the annual mourning
            for Tammuz. Tammuz was originally a Babylonian deity <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page086">[pg 086]</span><a name="Pg086" id=
            "Pg086" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> (Dumuzi), but his worship is
            specially identified with Phœnicia, whence under the name Adonis
            it was introduced into Greece. The mourning celebrates the death
            of the god, which is an emblem of the decay of the earth's
            productive powers, whether due to the scorching heat of the sun
            or to the cold of winter. It seems to have been a comparatively
            harmless rite of nature-religion, and its popularity among the
            women of Jerusalem at this time may be due to the prevailing mood
            of despondency which found vent in the sympathetic contemplation
            of that aspect of nature which most suggests decay and death.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The last and
            greatest of the abominations practised in and near the Temple is
            the worship of the sun. The peculiar enormity of this species of
            idolatry can hardly lie in the object of adoration; it is to be
            sought rather in the place where it was practised, and in the
            rank of those who took part in it, who were probably priests.
            Standing between the porch and the altar, with their backs to the
            Temple, these men unconsciously expressed the deliberate
            rejection of Jehovah which was involved in their idolatry. The
            worship of the heavenly bodies was probably imported into Israel
            from Assyria and Babylon, and its prevalence in the later years
            of the monarchy was due to political rather than religious
            influences. The gods of these imperial nations were esteemed more
            potent than those of the states which succumbed to their power,
            and hence men who were losing confidence in their national deity
            naturally sought to imitate the religions of the most powerful
            peoples known to them.<a id="noteref_28" name="noteref_28" href=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the
            arrangement of the four specimens of the religious <span class=

            Jerusalem, Ezekiel seems to proceed from the most familiar and
            explicable to the more outlandish defections from the purity of
            the national faith. At the same time his description shows how
            different classes of society were implicated in the sin of
            idolatry—the elders, the women, and the priests. During all this
            time the glory of Jehovah has stood in the court, and there is
            something very impressive in the picture of these infatuated men
            and women preoccupied with their unholy devotions and all
            unconscious of the presence of Him whom they deemed to have
            forsaken the land. To the open eye of the prophet the meaning of
            the vision must be already clear, but the sentence comes from the
            mouth of Jehovah Himself: <span class="tei tei-q">“Hast thou
            seen, Son of man? Is it too small a thing for the house of Judah
            to practise the abominations which they have here practised, that
            they must also fill the land with violence, and [so] provoke Me
            again to anger? So will I act towards them in anger: My eye shall
            not pity, nor will I spare”</span> (ch. viii. 17, 18).</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The last words
            introduce the account of the punishment of Jerusalem, which is
            given of course in the symbolic form suggested by the scenery of
            the vision. Jehovah has meanwhile risen from His throne near the
            cherubim, and stands on the threshold of the Temple. There He
            summons to His side the destroyers who are to execute His
            purpose—six angels, each with a weapon of destruction in his
            hand. A seventh of higher rank clothed in linen appears with the
            implements of a scribe in his girdle. These <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page088">[pg 088]</span><a name="Pg088" id=
            "Pg088" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> stand <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“beside the brazen altar,”</span> and await the
            commands of Jehovah. The first act of the judgment is a massacre
            of the inhabitants of the city, without distinction of age or
            rank or sex. But, in accordance with his strict view of the
            divine righteousness, Ezekiel is led to conceive of this last
            judgment as discriminating carefully between the righteous and
            the wicked. All those who have inwardly separated themselves from
            the guilt of the city by hearty detestation of the iniquities
            perpetrated in its midst are distinguished by a mark on their
            foreheads before the work of slaughter begins. What became of
            this faithful remnant it does not belong to the vision to
            declare. Beginning with the twenty men before the porch, the
            destroying angels follow the man with the inkhorn through the
            streets of the city, and slay all on whom he has not set his
            mark. When the messengers have gone out on their dread errand,
            Ezekiel, realising the full horror of a scene which he dare not
            describe, falls prostrate before Jehovah, deprecating the
            outbreak of indignation which threatened to extinguish
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the remnant of Israel.”</span> He is
            reassured by the declaration that the guilt of Judah and Israel
            demands no less a punishment than this, because the notion that
            Jehovah had forsaken the land had opened the floodgates of
            iniquity, and filled the land with bloodshed and the city with
            oppression. Then the man in the linen robes returns and
            announces, <span class="tei tei-q">“It is done as Thou hast
            commanded.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The second act
            of the judgment is the destruction of Jerusalem by fire. This is
            symbolised by the scattering over the city of burning coals taken
            from the altar-hearth under the throne of God. The man with the
            linen garments is directed to step between the wheels and take
            out fire for this purpose. The description of the execution of
            this order is again carried no further than what actually takes
            place before the prophet's eyes: the man took the <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page089">[pg 089]</span><a name="Pg089" id=
            "Pg089" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> fire and went out. In the
            place where we might have expected to have an account of the
            destruction of the city, we have a second description of the
            appearance and motions of the <span lang="he" class=
            "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="he"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">merkaba</span></span>, the purpose of which
            it is difficult to divine. Although it deviates slightly from the
            account in ch. i., the differences appear to have no
            significance, and indeed it is expressly said to be the same
            phenomenon. The whole passage is certainly superfluous, and might
            be omitted but for the difficulty of imagining any motive that
            would have tempted a scribe to insert it. We must keep in mind
            the possibility that this part of the book had been committed to
            writing before the final redaction of Ezekiel's prophecies, and
            the description in vv. 8-17 may have served a purpose there which
            is superseded by the fuller narrative which we now possess in ch.
            i.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this way
            Ezekiel penetrates more deeply into the inner meaning of the
            judgment on city and people whose external form he had announced
            in his earlier prophecy. It must be admitted that Jehovah's
            strange work bears to our minds a more appalling aspect when thus
            presented in symbols than the actual calamity would bear when
            effected through the agency of second causes. Whether it had the
            same effect on the mind of a Hebrew, who hardly believed in
            second causes, is another question. In any case it gives no
            ground for the charge made against Ezekiel of dwelling with a
            malignant satisfaction on the most repulsive features of a
            terrible picture. He is indeed capable of a rigorous logic in
            exhibiting the incidence of the law of retribution which was to
            him the necessary expression of the divine righteousness. That it
            included the death of every sinner and the overthrow of a city
            that had become a scene of violence and cruelty was to him a
            self-evident truth, and more than this the vision does not teach.
            On the contrary, it <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page090">[pg
            090]</span><a name="Pg090" id="Pg090" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            contains traits which tend to moderate the inevitable harshness
            of the truth conveyed. With great reticence it allows the
            execution of the judgment to take place behind the scenes, giving
            only those details which were necessary to suggest its nature.
            Whilst it is being carried out the attention of the reader is
            engaged in the presence of Jehovah, or his mind is occupied with
            the principles which made the punishment a moral necessity. The
            prophet's expostulations with Jehovah show that he was not
            insensible to the miseries of his people, although he saw them to
            be inevitable. Further, this vision shows as clearly as any
            passage in his writings the injustice of the view which
            represents him as more concerned for petty details of ceremonial
            than for the great moral interests of a nation. If any feeling
            expressed in the vision is to be regarded as Ezekiel's own, then
            indignation against outrages on human life and liberty must be
            allowed to weigh more with him than offences against ritual
            purity. And, finally, it is clearly one object of the vision to
            show that in the destruction of Jerusalem no individual shall be
            involved who is not also implicated in the guilt which calls down
            wrath upon her.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The second
            part of the vision (ch. xi.) is but loosely connected with the
            first. Here Jerusalem still exists, and men are alive who must
            certainly have perished in the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“visitation of the city”</span> if the writer had
            still kept himself within the limits of his previous conception.
            But in truth the two have little in common, except the Temple,
            which is the scene of both, and the cherubim, whose movements
            mark the transition from the one to the other. The glory of
            Jehovah is already departing from the house when it is stayed at
            the entrance of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page091">[pg
            091]</span><a name="Pg091" id="Pg091" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            east gate to give the prophet his special message to the
            exiles.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here we are
            introduced to the more political aspect of the situation in
            Jerusalem. The twenty-five men who are gathered in the east gate
            of the Temple are clearly the leading statesmen in the city; and
            two of them, whose names are given, are expressly designated as
            <span class="tei tei-q">“princes of the people.”</span> They are
            apparently met in conclave to deliberate on public matters, and a
            word from Jehovah lays open to the prophet the nature of their
            projects. <span class="tei tei-q">“These are the men that plan
            ruin, and hold evil counsel in this city.”</span> The evil
            counsel is undoubtedly the project of rebellion against the king
            of Babylon which must have been hatched at this time and which
            broke out into open revolt about three years later. The counsel
            was evil because directly opposed to that which Jeremiah was
            giving at the time in the name of Jehovah. But Ezekiel also
            throws invaluable light on the mood of the men who were urging
            the king along the path which led to ruin. <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Are not the houses recently built?”</span><a id=
            "noteref_29" name="noteref_29" href="#note_29"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">29</span></span></a> they
            say, congratulating themselves on their success in repairing the
            damage done to the city in the time of Jehoiachin. The image of
            the pot and the flesh is generally taken to express the feeling
            of easy security in the fortifications of Jerusalem with which
            these light-hearted politicians embarked on a contest with
            Nebuchadnezzar. But their mood must be a gloomier one than that
            if there is any appropriateness in the language they use. To stew
            in their own juice, and over a fire of their own kindling, could
            hardly seem a desirable policy to sane men, however strong the
            pot might be. These councillors are well aware of the dangers
            they incur, and of the misery which their purpose must
            necessarily bring on the people. But they are determined to
            hazard everything and endure everything on the chance
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page092">[pg 092]</span><a name=
            "Pg092" id="Pg092" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> that the city may
            prove strong enough to baffle the resources of the king of
            Babylon. Once the fire is kindled, it will certainly be better to
            be in the pot than in the fire; and so long as Jerusalem holds
            out they will remain behind her walls. The answer which is put
            into the prophet's mouth is that the issue will not be such as
            they hope for. The only <span class="tei tei-q">“flesh”</span>
            that will be left in the city will be the dead bodies of those
            who have been slain within her walls by the very men who hope
            that their lives will be given them for a prey. They themselves
            shall be dragged forth to meet their fate far away from Jerusalem
            on the <span class="tei tei-q">“borders of Israel.”</span> It is
            not unlikely that these conspirators kept their word. Although
            the king and all the men of war fled from the city as soon as a
            breach was made, we read of certain high officials who allowed
            themselves to be taken in the city (Jer. lii. 7). Ezekiel's
            prophecy was in their case literally fulfilled; for these men and
            many others were brought to the king of Babylon at Riblah,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“and he smote them and put them to death
            at Riblah in the land of Hamath.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While Ezekiel
            was uttering this prophecy one of the councillors, named
            Pelatiah, suddenly fell down dead. Whether a man of this name had
            suddenly died in Jerusalem under circumstances that had deeply
            impressed the prophet's mind, or whether the death belongs to the
            vision, it is impossible for us to tell. To Ezekiel the
            occurrence seemed an earnest of the complete destruction of the
            remnant of Israel by the wrath of God, and, as before, he fell on
            his face to intercede for them. It is then that he receives the
            message which seems to form the divine answer to the perplexities
            which haunted the minds of the exiles in Babylon.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In their
            attitude towards the exiles the new leaders in Jerusalem took up
            a position as highly privileged religious persons, quite at
            variance with the scepticism which <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page093">[pg 093]</span><a name="Pg093" id="Pg093" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> governed their conduct at home. When they
            were following the bent of their natural inclinations by
            practising idolatry and perpetrating judicial murders in the
            city, their cry was, <span class="tei tei-q">“Jehovah hath
            forsaken the land; Jehovah seeth it not.”</span> When they were
            eager to justify their claim to the places and possessions left
            vacant by their banished countrymen, they said, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“They are far from Jehovah: to us the land is given
            in possession.”</span> They were probably equally sincere and
            equally insincere in both professions. They had simply learned
            the art which comes easily to men of the world of using religion
            as a cloak for greed, and throwing it off when greed could be
            best gratified without it. The idea which lay under their
            religious attitude was that the exiles had gone into captivity
            because their sins had incurred Jehovah's anger, and that now His
            wrath was exhausted and the blessing of His favour would rest on
            those who had been left in the land. There was sufficient
            plausibility in the taunt to make it peculiarly galling to the
            mind of the exiles, who had hoped to exercise some influence over
            the government in Jerusalem, and to find their places kept for
            them when they should be permitted to return. It may well have
            been the resentment produced by tidings of this hostility towards
            them in Jerusalem that brought their elders to the house of
            Ezekiel to see if he had not some message from Jehovah to
            reassure them.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the mind of
            Ezekiel, however, the problem took another form. To him a return
            to the old Jerusalem had no meaning; neither buyer nor seller
            should have cause to congratulate himself on his position. The
            possession of the land of Israel belonged to those in whom
            Jehovah's ideal of the new Israel was realised, and the only
            question of religious importance was, Where is the germ of this
            new Israel to be found? Amongst those who survive the judgment in
            the old land, or amongst those who have <span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page094">[pg 094]</span><a name="Pg094" id="Pg094" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> experienced it in the form of banishment?
            On this point the prophet receives an explicit revelation in
            answer to his intercession for <span class="tei tei-q">“the
            remnant of Israel.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Son of man,
            thy brethren, thy brethren, thy fellow-captives, and the whole
            house of Israel of whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said,
            They are far from Jehovah: to us it is given—the land for an
            inheritance!... Because I have removed them far among the
            nations, and have scattered them among the lands, and have been
            to them but little of a sanctuary in the lands where they have
            gone, therefore say, Thus saith Jehovah, so will I gather you
            from the peoples, and bring you from the lands where ye have been
            scattered, and will give you the land of Israel.”</span> The
            difficult expression <span class="tei tei-q">“I have been but
            little of a sanctuary”</span> refers to the curtailment of
            religious privileges and means of access to Jehovah which was a
            necessary consequence of exile. It implies, however, that Israel
            in banishment had learned in some measure to preserve that
            separation from other peoples and that peculiar relation to
            Jehovah which constituted its national holiness. Religion perhaps
            perishes sooner from the overgrowth of ritual than from its
            deficiency. It is an historical fact that the very meagreness of
            the religion which could be practised in exile was the means of
            strengthening the more spiritual and permanent elements which
            constitute the essence of religion. The observances which could
            be maintained apart from the Temple acquired an importance which
            they never afterwards lost; and although some of these, such as
            circumcision, the Passover, the abstinence from forbidden food,
            were purely ceremonial, others, such as prayer, reading of the
            Scriptures, and the common worship of the synagogue, represent
            the purest and most indispensable forms in which communion with
            God can find expression. That Jehovah Himself became even in
            small measure what the word <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“sanctuary”</span> denotes indicates <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page095">[pg 095]</span><a name="Pg095" id=
            "Pg095" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> an enrichment of the
            religious consciousness of which perhaps Ezekiel himself did not
            perceive the full import.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The great
            lesson which Ezekiel's message seeks to impress on his hearers is
            that the tenure of the land of Israel depends on religious
            conditions. The land is Jehovah's, and He bestows it on those who
            are prepared to use it as His holiness demands. A pure land
            inhabited by a pure people is the ideal that underlies all
            Ezekiel's visions of the future. It is evident that in such a
            conception of the relation between God and His people ceremonial
            conditions must occupy a conspicuous place. The sanctity of the
            land is necessarily of a ceremonial order, and so the sanctity of
            the people must consist partly in a scrupulous regard for
            ceremonial requirements. But after all the condition of the land
            with respect to purity or uncleanness only reflects the character
            of the nation whose home it is. The things that defile a land are
            such things as idols and other emblems of heathenism, innocent
            blood unavenged, and unnatural crimes of various kinds. These
            things derive their whole significance from the state of mind and
            heart which they embody; they are the plain and palpable emblems
            of human sin. It is conceivable that to some minds the outward
            emblems may have seemed the true seat of evil, and their removal
            an end in itself apart from the direction of the will by which it
            was brought about. But it would be a mistake to charge Ezekiel
            with any such obliquity of moral vision. Although he conceives
            sin as a defilement that leaves its mark on the material world,
            he clearly teaches that its essence lies in the opposition of the
            human will to the will of God. The ceremonial purity required of
            every Israelite is only the expression of certain aspects of
            Jehovah's holy nature, the bearing of which on man's spiritual
            life may have been obscure to the prophet, and is still more
            obscure to us. And <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page096">[pg
            096]</span><a name="Pg096" id="Pg096" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            the truly valuable element in compliance with such rules was the
            obedience to Jehovah's expressed will which flowed from a nature
            in sympathy with His. Hence in this chapter, while the first
            thing that the restored exiles have to do is to cleanse the land
            of its abominations, this act will be the expression of a nature
            radically changed, doing the will of God from the heart. As the
            emblems of idolatry that defile the land were the outcome of an
            irresistible national tendency to evil, so the new and sensitive
            spirit, taking on the impress of Jehovah's holiness through the
            law, shall lead to the purification of the land from those things
            that had provoked the eyes of His glory. <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“They shall come thither, and remove thence all its
            detestable things and all its abominations. And I will give them
            another heart, and put a new spirit within them. I will take away
            the stony heart from their flesh, and give them a heart of flesh:
            that they may walk in My statutes, and keep My judgments, and do
            them: and so shall they be My people, and I will be their
            God”</span> (ch. xi. 18-20).</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus in the
            mind of the prophet Jerusalem and its Temple are already
            virtually destroyed. He seemed to linger in the Temple court
            until he saw the chariot of Jehovah withdrawn from the city as a
            token that the glory had departed from Israel. Then the ecstasy
            passed away, and he found himself in the presence of the men to
            whom the hope of the future had been offered, but who were as yet
            unworthy to receive it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In spite of the
          interest excited by Ezekiel's prophetic appearances, the exiles
          still received his prediction of the fall of Jerusalem with the
          most stolid incredulity. It proved to be an impossible task to
          disabuse their minds of the prepossessions which made such an event
          absolutely incredible. True to their character as a disobedient
          house, they had <span class="tei tei-q">“eyes to see, and saw not;
          and ears to hear, but heard not”</span> (ch. xii. 2). They were
          intensely interested in the strange signs he performed, and
          listened with pleasure to his fervid oratory; but the inner meaning
          of it all never sank into their minds. Ezekiel was well aware that
          the cause of this obtuseness lay in the false ideals which
          nourished an overweening confidence in the destiny of their nation.
          And these ideals were the more difficult to destroy because they
          each contained an element of truth, so interwoven with the
          falsehood that to the mind of the people the true and the false
          stood and fell together. If the great vision of chs. viii.-xi. had
          accomplished its purpose, it would doubtless have taken away the
          main support of these delusive imaginations. But the belief in the
          indestructibility of the Temple was only one of a number of roots
          through which the vain confidence of the nation was fed; and so
          long as any of these remained the people's sense of security was
          likely <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page098">[pg
          098]</span><a name="Pg098" id="Pg098" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          to remain. These spurious ideals, therefore, Ezekiel sets himself
          with characteristic thoroughness to demolish one after another.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This appears to
          be in the main the purpose of the third subdivision of his
          prophecies on which we now enter. It extends from ch. xii. to ch.
          xix.; and in so far as it can be taken to represent a phase of his
          actual spoken ministry, it must be assigned to the fifth year
          before the capture of Jerusalem (August 591-August 590 <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>). But since the
          passage is an exposition of ideas more than a narrative of
          experiences we may expect to find that chronological consistency
          has been even less observed than in the earlier part of the book.
          Each idea is presented in the completeness which it finally
          possessed in the prophet's mind, and his allusions may anticipate a
          state of things which had not actually arisen till a somewhat later
          date. Beginning with a description and interpretation of two
          symbolic actions intended to impress more vividly on the people the
          certainty of the impending catastrophe, the prophet proceeds in a
          series of set discourses to expose the hollowness of the illusions
          which his fellow-exiles cherished, such as disbelief in prophecies
          of evil, faith in the destiny of Israel, veneration for the Davidic
          kingdom, and reliance on the solidarity of the nation in sin and in
          judgment. These are the principal topics which the course of
          exposition will bring before us, and in dealing with them it will
          be convenient to depart from the order in which they stand in the
          book and adopt an arrangement according to subject. By so doing we
          run the risk of missing the order of the ideas as it presented
          itself to the prophet's mind, and of ignoring the remarkable skill
          with which the transition from one theme to another is frequently
          effected. But if we have rightly understood the scope of the
          passage as a whole, this will not prevent us from grasping the
          substance of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page099">[pg
          099]</span><a name="Pg099" id="Pg099" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          his teaching or its bearing on the final message which he had to
          deliver. In the present chapter we shall accordingly group together
          three passages which deal with the fate of the monarchy, and
          especially of Zedekiah, the last king of Judah.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That reverence
          for the royal house would form an obstacle to the acceptance of
          such teaching as Ezekiel's was to be expected from all we know of
          the popular feeling on this subject. The fact that the few royal
          assassinations which stain the annals of Judah were sooner or later
          avenged by the people shows that the monarchy was regarded as a
          pillar of the state, and that great importance was attached to the
          possession of a dynasty which perpetuated the glories of David's
          reign. And there is one verse in the book of Lamentations which
          expresses the anguish which the fall of the kingdom caused to godly
          men in Israel, although its representative was so unworthy of his
          office as Zedekiah: <span class="tei tei-q">“The breath of our
          nostrils, the anointed of Jehovah, was taken in their pits, of whom
          we said, Under his shadow shall we live among the nations”</span>
          (Lam. iv. 20). So long therefore as a descendant of David sat on
          the throne of Jerusalem it would seem the duty of every patriotic
          Israelite to remain true to him. The continuance of the monarchy
          would seem to guarantee the existence of the state; the prestige of
          Zedekiah's position as the anointed of Jehovah, and the heir of
          David's covenant, would warrant the hope that even yet Jehovah
          would intervene to save an institution of His own creating. Indeed,
          we can see from Ezekiel's own pages that the historic monarchy in
          Israel was to him an object of the highest veneration and regard.
          He speaks of its dignity in terms whose very exaggeration shows how
          largely the fact bulked in his imagination. He compares it to the
          noblest of the wild beasts of the earth and the most lordly tree of
          the forest. But his contention is that this <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page100">[pg 100]</span><a name="Pg100" id="Pg100"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> monarchy no longer exists. Except in
          one doubtful passage, he never applies the title king (<span lang=
          "he" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="he"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">melek</span></span>) to Zedekiah. The kingdom
          came to an end with the deportation of Jehoiachin, the last king
          who ascended the throne in legitimate succession. The present
          holder of the office is in no sense king by divine right; he is a
          creature and vassal of Nebuchadnezzar, and has no rights against
          his suzerain.<a id="noteref_30" name="noteref_30" href=
          "#note_30"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">30</span></span></a> His
          very name had been changed by the caprice of his master. As a
          religious symbol, therefore, the royal power is defunct; the glory
          has departed from it as surely as from the Temple. The makeshift
          administration organised under Zedekiah had a peaceful if
          inglorious future before it, if it were content to recognise facts
          and adapt itself to its humble position. But if it should attempt
          to raise its head and assert itself as an independent kingdom, it
          would only seal its own doom. And for men in Chaldæa to transfer to
          this shadow of kingly dignity the allegiance due to the heir of
          David's house was a waste of devotion as little demanded by
          patriotism as by prudence.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first of
            the passages in which the fate of the monarchy is foretold
            requires little to be said by way of explanation. It is a
            symbolic action of the kind with which we are now familiar,
            exhibiting the certainty of the fate in store both for the people
            and the king. The prophet again becomes a <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“sign”</span> or portent to the people—this time in a
            character which every one of his audience understood from recent
            experience. He is seen by daylight collecting <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“articles of captivity”</span>—<span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
            such necessary <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page101">[pg
            101]</span><a name="Pg101" id="Pg101" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            articles as a person going into exile would try to take with
            him—and bringing them out to the door of his house. Then at dusk
            he breaks through the wall with his goods on his shoulder; and,
            with face muffled, he removes <span class="tei tei-q">“to another
            place.”</span> In this sign we have again two different facts
            indicated by a series of not entirely congruous actions. The mere
            act of carrying out his most necessary furniture and removing
            from one place to another suggests quite unambiguously the
            captivity that awaits the inhabitants of Jerusalem. But the
            accessories of the action, such as breaking through the wall, the
            muffling of the face, and the doing of all this by night, point
            to quite a different event—viz., Zedekiah's attempt to break
            through the Chaldæan lines by night, his capture, his blindness,
            and his imprisonment in Babylon. The most remarkable thing in the
            sign is the circumstantial manner in which the details of the
            king's flight and capture are anticipated so long before the
            event. Zedekiah, as we read in the second book of Kings, as soon
            as a breach was made in the walls by the Chaldæans, broke out
            with a small party of horsemen, and succeeded in reaching the
            plain of Jordan. There he was overtaken and caught, and sent
            before Nebuchadnezzar's presence at Riblah. The Babylonian king
            punished his perfidy with a cruelty common enough amongst the
            Assyrian kings: he caused his eyes to be put out, and sent him
            thus to end his days in prison at Babylon. All this is so clearly
            hinted at in the signs that the whole representation is often set
            aside as a prophecy after the event. That is hardly probable,
            because the sign does not bear the marks of having been
            originally conceived with the view of exhibiting the details of
            Zedekiah's punishment. But since we know that the book was
            written after the event, it is a perfectly fair question whether
            in the interpretation of the symbols Ezekiel may not have read
            into it a fuller meaning than <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page102">[pg 102]</span><a name="Pg102" id="Pg102" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> was present to his own mind at the time.
            Thus the covering of his head does not necessarily suggest
            anything more than the king's attempt to disguise his
            person.<a id="noteref_31" name="noteref_31" href=
            "#note_31"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">31</span></span></a>
            Possibly this was all that Ezekiel originally meant by it. When
            the event took place he perceived a further meaning in it as an
            allusion to the blindness inflicted on the king, and introduced
            this into the explanation given of the symbol. The point of it
            lies in the degradation of the king through his being reduced to
            such an ignominious method of securing his personal safety.
            <span class="tei tei-q">“The prince that is among them shall bear
            upon his shoulder in the darkness, and shall go forth: they shall
            dig through the wall to carry out thereby: he shall cover his
            face, that he may not be seen by any eye, and he himself shall
            not see the earth”</span> (ch. xii. 12).</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In ch. xvii.
            the fate of the monarchy is dealt with at greater length under
            the form of an allegory. The kingdom of Judah is represented as a
            cedar in Lebanon—a comparison which shows how exalted were
            Ezekiel's conceptions of the dignity of the old regime which had
            now passed away. But the leading shoot of the tree has been
            cropped off by a great, broad-winged, speckled eagle, the king of
            Babylon, and carried away to a <span class="tei tei-q">“land of
            traffic, a city of merchants.”</span><a id="noteref_32" name=
            "noteref_32" href="#note_32"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">32</span></span></a> The
            insignificance of Zedekiah's government is indicated by a harsh
            contrast which <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page103">[pg
            103]</span><a name="Pg103" id="Pg103" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            almost breaks the consistency of the figure. In place of the
            cedar which he has spoiled the eagle plants a low vine trailing
            on the ground, such as may be seen in Palestine at the present
            day. His intention was that <span class="tei tei-q">“its branches
            should extend towards him and its roots be under
            him”</span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, that the new
            principality should derive all its strength from Babylon and
            yield all its produce to the power which nourished it. For a time
            all went well. The vine answered the expectations of its owner,
            and prospered under the favourable conditions which he had
            provided for it. But another great eagle appeared on the scene,
            the king of Egypt, and the ungrateful vine began to send out its
            roots and turn its branches in his direction. The meaning is
            obvious: Zedekiah had sent presents to Egypt and sought its help,
            and by so doing had violated the conditions of his tenure of
            royal power. Such a policy could not prosper. <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“The bed where it was planted”</span> was in
            possession of Nebuchadnezzar, and he could not tolerate there a
            state, however feeble, which employed the resources with which he
            had endowed it to further the interests of his rival, Hophra, the
            king of Egypt. Its destruction shall come from the quarter whence
            it derived its origin: <span class="tei tei-q">“when the east
            wind smites it, it shall wither in the furrow where it
            grew.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Throughout
            this passage Ezekiel shows that he possessed in full measure that
            penetration and detachment from local prejudices which all the
            prophets exhibit when dealing with political affairs. The
            interpretation of the riddle contains a statement of
            Nebuchadnezzar's policy in his dealings with Judah, whose
            impartial accuracy could not be improved on by the most
            disinterested historian. The carrying away of the Judæan king and
            aristocracy was a heavy blow to religious susceptibilities which
            Ezekiel fully shared, and its severity was not mitigated by the
            arrogant assumptions by which it was explained <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page104">[pg 104]</span><a name="Pg104" id=
            "Pg104" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> in Jerusalem. Yet here he
            shows himself capable of contemplating it as a measure of
            Babylonian statesmanship and of doing absolute justice to the
            motives by which it was dictated. Nebuchadnezzar's purpose was to
            establish a petty state unable to raise itself to independence,
            and one on whose fidelity to his empire he could rely. Ezekiel
            lays great stress on the solemn formalities by which the great
            king had bound his vassal to his allegiance: <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“He took of the royal seed, and made a covenant with
            him, and brought him under a curse; and the strong ones of the
            land he took away: that it might be a lowly kingdom, not able to
            lift itself up, to keep his covenant that it might stand”</span>
            (vv. 13, 14). In all this Nebuchadnezzar is conceived as acting
            within his rights; and here lay the difference between the clear
            vision of the prophet and the infatuated policy of his
            contemporaries. The politicians of Jerusalem were incapable of
            thus discerning the signs of the times. They fell back on the
            time-honoured plan of checkmating Babylon by means of an Egyptian
            alliance—a policy which had been disastrous when attempted
            against the ruthless tyrants of Assyria, and which was doubly
            imbecile when it brought down on them the wrath of a monarch who
            showed every desire to deal fairly with his subject
            provinces.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The period of
            intrigue with Egypt had already begun when this prophecy was
            written. We have no means of knowing how long the negotiations
            went on before the overt act of rebellion; and hence we cannot
            say with certainty that the appearance of the chapter in this
            part of the book is an anachronism. It is possible that Ezekiel
            may have known of a secret mission which was not discovered by
            the spies of the Babylonian court; and there is no difficulty in
            supposing that such a step may have been taken as early as two
            and a half years before the outbreak of hostilities. At whatever
            time it took place, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page105">[pg
            105]</span><a name="Pg105" id="Pg105" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            Ezekiel saw that it sealed the doom of the nation. He knew that
            Nebuchadnezzar could not overlook such flagrant perfidy as
            Zedekiah and his councillors had been guilty of; he knew also
            that Egypt could render no effectual help to Jerusalem in her
            death-struggle. <span class="tei tei-q">“Not with a strong army
            and a great host will Pharaoh act for him in the war, when mounds
            are thrown up, and the towers are built, to cut off many
            lives”</span> (ver. 17). The writer of the Lamentations again
            shows us how sadly the prophet's anticipation was verified:
            <span class="tei tei-q">“As for us, our eyes as yet failed for
            our vain help: in our watching we have watched for a nation that
            could not save us”</span> (Lam. iv. 17).</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But Ezekiel
            will not allow it to be supposed that the fate of Jerusalem is
            merely the result of a mistaken forecast of political
            probabilities. Such a mistake had been made by Zedekiah's
            advisers when they trusted to Egypt to deliver them from Babylon,
            and ordinary prudence might have warned them against it. But that
            was the most excusable part of their folly. The thing that
            branded their policy as infamous and put them absolutely in the
            wrong before God and man alike was their violation of the solemn
            oath by which they had bound themselves to serve the king of
            Babylon. The prophet seizes on this act of perjury as the
            determining fact of the situation, and charges it home on the
            king as the cause of the ruin that is to overtake him:
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Thus saith Jehovah, As I live, surely
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">My</span></em> oath which he hath despised,
            and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">My</span></em> covenant which he has broken,
            I will return on his head; and I will spread My net over him, and
            in My snare shall he be taken, ... and ye shall know that I
            Jehovah have spoken it”</span> (vv. 19-21).</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the last
            three verses of the chapter the prophet returns to the allegory
            with which he commenced, and completes his oracle with a
            beautiful picture of the ideal monarchy of the future. The ideas
            on which the picture <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page106">[pg
            106]</span><a name="Pg106" id="Pg106" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            is framed are few and simple; but they are those which
            distinguish the Messianic hope as cherished by the prophets from
            the crude form which it assumed in the popular imagination. In
            contrast to Zedekiah's kingdom, which was a human institution
            without ideal significance, that of the Messianic age will be a
            fresh creation of Jehovah's power. A tender shoot shall be
            planted in the mountain land of Israel, where it shall flourish
            and increase until it overshadow the whole earth. Further, this
            shoot is taken from the <span class="tei tei-q">“top of the
            cedar”</span>—that is, the section of the royal house which had
            been carried away to Babylon—indicating that the hope of the
            future lay not with the king <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">de
            facto</span></span> Zedekiah, but with Jehoiachin and those who
            shared his banishment. The passage leaves no doubt that Ezekiel
            conceived the Israel of the future as a state with a monarch at
            its head, although it may be doubtful whether the shoot refers to
            a personal Messiah or to the aristocracy, who, along with the
            king, formed the governing body in an Eastern kingdom. This
            question, however, can be better considered when we have to deal
            with Ezekiel's Messianic conceptions in their fully developed
            form in ch. xxxiv.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of the last
            four kings of Judah there were two whose melancholy fate seems to
            have excited a profound feeling of pity amongst their countrymen.
            Jehoahaz or Shallum, according to the Chronicler the youngest of
            Josiah's sons, appears to have been even during his father's
            lifetime a popular favourite. It was he who after the fatal day
            of Megiddo was raised to the throne by the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“people of the land”</span> at the age of
            twenty-three years. He is said by the historian of the books of
            Kings to have done <span class="tei tei-q">“that which was evil
            in the sight of the Lord”</span>; but he had <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page107">[pg 107]</span><a name="Pg107" id=
            "Pg107" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> hardly time to display his
            qualities as a ruler, when he was deposed and carried to Egypt by
            Pharaoh Necho, having worn the crown for only three months (608
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>). The deep
            attachment felt for him seems to have given rise to an
            expectation that he would be restored to his kingdom, a delusion
            against which the prophet Jeremiah found it necessary to protest
            (Jer. xxii. 10-12). He was succeeded by his elder brother,
            Eliakim,<a id="noteref_33" name="noteref_33" href=
            "#note_33"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">33</span></span></a> the
            headstrong and selfish tyrant, whose character stands revealed in
            some passages of the books of Jeremiah and Habakkuk. His reign of
            nine years gave little occasion to his subjects to cherish a
            grateful memory of his administration. He died in the crisis of
            the conflict he had provoked with the king of Babylon, leaving
            his youthful son Jehoiachin to expiate the folly of his
            rebellion. Jehoiachin is the second idol of the populace to whom
            we have referred. He was only eighteen years old when he was
            called to the throne, and within three months he was doomed to
            exile in Babylon. In his room Nebuchadnezzar appointed a third
            son of Josiah—Mattaniah—whose name he changed to Zedekiah. He was
            apparently a man of weak and vacillating character; but he fell
            ultimately into the hands of the Egyptian and anti-prophetic
            party, and so was the means of involving his country in the
            hopeless struggle in which it perished.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The fact that
            two of their native princes were languishing, perhaps
            simultaneously, in foreign confinement, one in Egypt and the
            other in Babylon, was fitted to evoke in Judah a sympathy with
            the misfortunes of royalty something like the feeling embalmed in
            the Jacobite songs of Scotland. It seems to be an echo of this
            sentiment that we find in the first part of the lament with which
            Ezekiel closes his references to the fall of the monarchy (ch.
            xix.). Many critics have indeed found it impossible to suppose
            that Ezekiel should in any sense have yielded <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page108">[pg 108]</span><a name="Pg108" id=
            "Pg108" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> to sympathy with the fate of
            two princes who are both branded in the historical books as
            idolaters, and whose calamities on Ezekiel's own view of
            individual retribution proved them to be sinners against Jehovah.
            Yet it is certainly unnatural to read the dirge in any other
            sense than as an expression of genuine pity for the woes that the
            nation suffered in the fate of her two exiled kings. If Jeremiah,
            in pronouncing the doom of Shallum or Jehoahaz, could say,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Weep ye sore for him that goeth away;
            for he shall not return any more, nor see his native
            country,”</span> there is no reason why Ezekiel should not have
            given lyrical expression to the universal feeling of sadness
            which the blighted career of these two youths naturally produced.
            The whole passage is highly poetical, and represents a side of
            Ezekiel's nature which we have not hitherto been led to study.
            But it is too much to expect of even the most logical of prophets
            that he should experience no personal emotion but what fitted
            into his system, or that his poetic gift should be chained to the
            wheels of his theological convictions. The dirge expresses no
            moral judgment on the character or deserts of the two kings to
            which it refers: it has but one theme—the sorrow and
            disappointment of the <span class="tei tei-q">“mother”</span> who
            nurtured and lost them, that is, the nation of Israel personified
            according to a usual Hebrew figure of speech. All attempts to go
            beyond this and to find in the poem an allegorical portrait of
            Jehoahaz and Jehoiachin are irrelevant. The mother is a lioness,
            the princes are young lions and behave as stalwart young lions
            do, but whether their exploits are praiseworthy or the reverse is
            a question that was not present to the writer's mind.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The chapter is
            entitled <span class="tei tei-q">“A Dirge on the Princes of
            Israel,”</span> and embraces not only the fate of Jehoahaz and
            Jehoiachin, but also of Zedekiah, with whom the old monarchy
            expired. Strictly speaking, however, the name <span class=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The poetry
            here is simple and sincere. The mournful cadence of the elegiac
            measure, which is maintained throughout, is adapted to the tone
            of melancholy which pervades the passage and culminates in the
            last beautiful line. The dirge is a form of composition often
            employed in songs of triumph over the calamities of enemies; but
            there is no reason to doubt that here it is true to its original
            purpose, and expresses genuine sorrow for the accumulated
            misfortunes of the royal house of Israel.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The closing
            part of the <span class="tei tei-q">“dirge”</span> dealing with
            Zedekiah is of a somewhat different character. The theme is
            similar, but the figure is abruptly changed, and the elegiac
            rhythm is abandoned. The nation, the mother of the monarchy, is
            here compared to a luxuriant vine planted beside great waters;
            and the royal house is likened to a branch towering above the
            rest and bearing rods which were kingly sceptres. But she has
            been plucked up by the roots, withered, scorched by the fire, and
            finally planted in an arid region where she cannot thrive. The
            application of the metaphor to the ruin of the nation is very
            obvious. Israel, once a prosperous nation, richly endowed with
            all the conditions of a vigorous national life, and glorying in
            her race of native kings, is now humbled to the dust. Misfortune
            after misfortune has destroyed her power and blighted her
            prospects, till at last she has been removed from her own land to
            a place where national life cannot be maintained. But the point
            of the passage lies in the closing words: fire went out from one
            of her twigs and consumed her branches, so that she has no longer
            a proud <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page111">[pg
            111]</span><a name="Pg111" id="Pg111" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            rod to be a ruler's sceptre (ver. 14). The monarchy, once the
            glory and strength of Israel, has in its last degenerate
            representative involved the nation in ruin.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such is
            Ezekiel's final answer to those of his hearers who clung to the

          Abuses. Chapters xii. 21-xiv. 11.</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is perhaps
          nothing more perplexing to the student of Old Testament history
          than the complicated phenomena which may be classed under the
          general name of <span class="tei tei-q">“prophecy.”</span> In
          Israel, as in every ancient state, there was a body of men who
          sought to influence public opinion by prognostications of the
          future. As a rule the repute of all kinds of divination declined
          with the advance of civilisation and general intelligence, so that
          in the more enlightened communities matters of importance came to
          be decided on broad grounds of reason and political expediency. The
          peculiarity in the case of Israel was that the very highest
          direction in politics, as well as religion and morals, was given in
          a form capable of being confounded with superstitious practices
          which flourished alongside of it. The true prophets were not merely
          profound moral thinkers, who announced a certain issue as the
          probable result of a certain line of conduct. In many cases their
          predictions are absolute, and their political programme is an
          appeal to the nation to accept the situation which they foresee, as
          the basis of its public action. For this reason prophecy was
          readily brought into competition with practices with which it had
          really nothing in common. The ordinary individual who cared little
          for principles and only wished to know what was likely <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page113">[pg 113]</span><a name="Pg113" id="Pg113"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> to happen might readily think that one
          way of arriving at knowledge of the future was as good as another,
          and when the spiritual prophet's anticipations displeased him he
          was apt to try his luck with the sorcerer. It is not improbable
          that in the last days of the monarchy spurious prophecy of various
          kinds gained an additional vitality from its rivalry with the great
          spiritual teachers who in the name of Jehovah foretold the ruin of
          the state.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is not the
          place for an exhaustive account of the varied developments in
          Israel of what may be broadly termed prophetic manifestations. For
          the understanding of the section of Ezekiel now before us it will
          be enough to distinguish three classes of phenomena. At the lowest
          end of the scale there was a rank growth of pure magic or sorcery,
          the ruling idea of which is the attempt to control or forecast the
          future by occult arts which are believed to influence the
          supernatural powers which govern human destiny. In the second place
          we have prophecy in a stricter sense—that is, the supposed
          revelation of the will of the deity in dreams or <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“visions”</span> or half-articulate words uttered in a
          state of frenzy. Last of all there is the true prophet, who, though
          subject to extraordinary mental experiences, yet had always a clear
          and conscious grasp of moral principles, and possessed an
          incommunicable certainty that what he spoke was not his own word
          but the word of Jehovah.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is obvious
          that a people subjected to such influences as these was exposed to
          temptations both intellectual and moral from which modern life is
          exempt. One thing is certain—the existence of prophecy did not tend
          to simplify the problems of national life or individual conduct. We
          are apt to think of the great prophets as men so signally marked
          out by God as His witnesses that it must have been impossible for
          any one with a shred of sincerity to question their authority. In
          reality <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page114">[pg
          114]</span><a name="Pg114" id="Pg114" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          it was quite otherwise. It was no more an easy thing then than now
          to distinguish between truth and error, between the voice of God
          and the speculations of men. Then, as now, divine truth had no
          available credentials at the moment of its utterance except its
          self-evidencing power on hearts that were sincere in their desire
          to know it. The fact that truth came in the guise of prophecy only
          stimulated the growth of counterfeit prophecy, so that only those
          who were <span class="tei tei-q">“of the truth”</span> could
          discern the spirits, whether they were of God.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The passage
          which forms the subject of this chapter is one of the most
          important passages of the Old Testament in its treatment of the
          errors and abuses incident to a dispensation of prophecy. It
          consists of three parts: the first deals with difficulties
          occasioned by the apparent failure of prophecy (ch. xii. 21-28);
          the second with the character and doom of the false prophets (ch.
          xiii.); and the third with the state of mind which made a right use
          of prophecy impossible (ch. xiv. 1-11).</p>

          <div class="tei tei-div" style=
          "margin-bottom: 3.00em; margin-top: 3.00em">
            <h3 class="tei tei-head" style=
            "margin-bottom: 2.40em; margin-top: 2.40em; text-align: left">
            <span style="font-size: 120%">I</span></h3>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is one of
            Ezekiel's peculiarities that he pays close attention to the
            proverbial sayings which indicated the drift of the national
            mind. Such sayings were like straws, showing how the stream
            flowed, and had a special significance for Ezekiel, inasmuch as
            he was not in the stream himself, but only observed its motions
            from a distance. Here he quotes a current proverb, giving
            expression to a sense of the futility of all prophetic warnings:
            <span class="tei tei-q">“The days are drawn out, and every vision
            faileth”</span> (ch. xii. 22). It is difficult to say what the
            feeling is that lies behind it, whether it is one of
            disappointment or of relief. If, as seems probable, ver. 27 is
            the application of the general principle to the particular case
            of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page115">[pg 115]</span><a name=
            "Pg115" id="Pg115" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Ezekiel, the
            proverb need not indicate absolute disbelief in the truth of
            prophecy. <span class="tei tei-q">“The vision which he sees is
            for many days, and remote times does he prophesy”</span>—that is
            to say, The prophet's words are no doubt perfectly true, and come
            from God; but no man can ever tell when they are to be fulfilled:
            all experience shows that they relate to a remote future which we
            are not likely to see. For men whose concern was to find
            direction in the present emergency, that was no doubt equivalent
            to a renunciation of the guidance of prophecy.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are
            several things which may have tended to give currency to this
            view and make it plausible. First of all, of course, the fact
            that many of the <span class="tei tei-q">“visions”</span> that
            were published had nothing in them; they were false in their
            origin, and were bound to fail. Accordingly one thing necessary
            to rescue prophecy from the discredit into which it had fallen
            was the removal of those who uttered false predictions in the
            name of Jehovah: <span class="tei tei-q">“There shall no more be
            any false vision or flattering divination in the midst of the
            house of Israel”</span> (ver. 24). But besides the prevalence of
            false prophecy there were features of true prophecy which partly
            explained the common misgiving as to its trustworthiness. Even in
            true prophecy there is an element of idealism, the future being
            depicted in forms derived from the prophet's circumstances, and
            represented as the immediate continuation of the events of his
            own time. In support of the proverb it might have been equally
            apt to instance the Messianic oracles of Isaiah, or the confident
            predictions of Hananiah, the opponent of Jeremiah. Further, there
            is a contingent element in prophecy: the fulfilment of a threat
            or promise is conditional on the moral effect of the prophecy
            itself on the people. These things were perfectly understood by
            thoughtful men in Israel. The principle of contingency is clearly
            expounded in the eighteenth chapter of Jeremiah, <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page116">[pg 116]</span><a name="Pg116" id=
            "Pg116" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and it was acted on by the
            princes who on a memorable occasion saved him from the doom of a
            false prophet (Jer. xxvi.). Those who used prophecy to determine
            their practical attitude towards Jehovah's purposes found it to
            be an unerring guide to right thinking and action. But those who
            only took a curious interest in questions of external fulfilment
            found much to disconcert them; and it is hardly surprising that
            many of them became utterly sceptical of its divine origin. It
            must have been to this turn of mind that the proverb with which
            Ezekiel is dealing owed its origin.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is not on
            these lines, however, that Ezekiel vindicates the truth of the
            prophetic word, but on lines adapted to the needs of his own
            generation. After all, prophecy is not wholly contingent. The
            bent of the popular character is one of the elements which it
            takes into account, and it foresees an issue which is not
            dependent on anything that Israel might do. The prophets rise to
            a point of view from which the destruction of the sinful people
            and the establishment of a perfect kingdom of God are seen to be
            facts unalterably decreed by Jehovah. And the point of Ezekiel's
            answer to his contemporaries seems to be that a final
            demonstration of the truth of prophecy was at hand. As the
            fulfilment drew near, prophecy would increase in distinctness and
            precision, so that when the catastrophe came it would be
            impossible for any man to deny the inspiration of those who had
            announced it: <span class="tei tei-q">“Thus saith Jehovah, I will
            suppress this proverb, and it shall no more circulate in Israel;
            but say unto them, The days are near, and the content [literally
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">word</span></em> or <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">matter</span></em>] of every vision”</span>
            (ver. 23). After the extinction of every form of lying prophecy,
            Jehovah's words shall still be heard, and the proclamation of
            them shall be immediately followed by their accomplishment:
            <span class="tei tei-q">“For I Jehovah will speak My words; I
            will speak and perform, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page117">[pg

            rebellion, I will speak a word and perform it, saith
            Jehovah”</span> (ver. 25). The immediate reference is to the
            destruction of Jerusalem which the prophet saw to be one of those
            events which were unconditionally decreed, and an event which
            must bulk more and more largely in the vision of the true prophet
            until it was accomplished.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The thirteenth
            chapter deals with what was undoubtedly the greatest obstacle to
            the influence of prophecy—viz., the existence of a division in
            the ranks of the prophets themselves. That division had been of
            long standing. The earliest indication of it is the story of the
            contest between Micaiah and four hundred prophets of Jehovah, in
            presence of Ahab and Jehoshaphat (1 Kings xxii. 5-28). All the
            canonical prophets show in their writings that they had to
            contend against the mass of the prophetic order—men who claimed
            an authority equal to theirs, but used it for diametrically
            opposite interests. It is not, however, till we come to Jeremiah
            and Ezekiel that we find a formal apologetic of true prophecy
            against false. The problem was serious: where two sets of
            prophets systematically and fundamentally contradicted each
            other, both might be false, but both could not be true. The
            prophet who was convinced of the truth of his own visions must be
            prepared to account for the rise of false visions, and to lay
            down some criterion by which men might discriminate between the
            one and the other. Jeremiah's treatment of the question is of the
            two perhaps the more profound and interesting. It is thus
            summarised by Professor Davidson: <span class="tei tei-q">“In his
            encounters with the prophets of his day Jeremiah opposes them in
            three spheres—that of policy, that of morals, and that of
            personal experience. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page118">[pg
            118]</span><a name="Pg118" id="Pg118" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            In policy the genuine prophets had some fixed principles, all
            arising out of the idea that the kingdom of the Lord was not a
            kingdom of this world. Hence they opposed military preparation,
            riding on horses, and building of fenced cities, and counselled
            trust in Jehovah.... The false prophets, on the other hand,
            desired their country to be a military power among the powers
            around, they advocated alliance with the eastern empires and with
            Egypt, and relied on their national strength. Again, the true
            prophets had a stringent personal and state morality. In their
            view the true cause of the destruction of the state was its
            immoralities. But the false prophets had no such deep moral
            convictions, and seeing nothing unwonted or alarming in the
            condition of things prophesied of <span class=
            "tei tei-q">‘peace.’</span> They were not necessarily irreligious
            men; but their religion had no truer insight into the nature of
            the God of Israel than that of the common people.... And finally
            Jeremiah expresses his conviction that the prophets whom he
            opposed did not stand in the same relation to the Lord as he did:
            they had not his experiences of the word of the Lord, into whose
            counsel they had not been admitted; and they were without that
            fellowship of mind with the mind of Jehovah which was the true
            source of prophecy. Hence he satirises their pretended
            supernatural <span class="tei tei-q">‘dreams,’</span> and charges
            them from conscious want of any true prophetic word with stealing
            words from one another.”</span><a id="noteref_37" name=
            "noteref_37" href="#note_37"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The passages
            in Jeremiah on which this statement is mainly founded may have
            been known to Ezekiel, who in this matter, as in so many others,
            follows the lines laid down by the elder prophet.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first
            thing, then, that deserves attention in Ezekiel's judgment on
            false prophecy is his assertion of its purely <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page119">[pg 119]</span><a name="Pg119" id=
            "Pg119" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> subjective or human origin.
            In the opening sentence he pronounces a woe upon the prophets
            <span class="tei tei-q">“who prophesy <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">from their own
            mind</span></em> without having seen”</span><a id="noteref_38"
            name="noteref_38" href="#note_38"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">38</span></span></a>
            (ver. 3). The words put in italics sum up Ezekiel's theory of the
            genesis of false prophecy. The visions these men see and the
            oracles they utter simply reproduce the thoughts, the emotions,
            the aspirations, natural to their own minds. That the ideas came
            to them in a peculiar form, which was mistaken for the direct
            action of Jehovah, Ezekiel does not deny. He admits that the men
            were sincere in their professions, for he describes them as
            <span class="tei tei-q">“waiting for the fulfilment of the
            word”</span> (ver. 6). But in this belief they were the victims
            of a delusion. Whatever there might be in their prophetic
            experiences that resembled those of a true prophet, there was
            nothing in their oracles that did not belong to the sphere of
            worldly interests and human speculation.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If we ask how
            Ezekiel knew this, the only possible answer is that he knew it
            because he was sure of the source of his own inspiration. He
            possessed an inward experience which certified to him the
            genuineness of the communications which came to him, and he
            necessarily inferred that those who held different beliefs about
            God must lack that experience. Thus far his criticism of false
            prophecy is purely subjective. The true prophet knew that he had
            that within him which authenticated his inspiration, but the
            false prophet could not know that he wanted it. The difficulty is
            not peculiar to prophecy, but arises in connection with religious
            belief as a whole. It is an interesting question whether the
            assent to a truth is accompanied by a feeling of certitude
            differing in quality from the confidence which a man may have in
            giving his assent to a delusion. But it is not possible to
            elevate this internal criterion to an <span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page120">[pg 120]</span><a name="Pg120" id="Pg120" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> objective test of truth. A man who is awake
            may be quite sure he is not dreaming, but a man in a dream may
            readily enough fancy himself awake.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But there were
            other and more obvious tests which could be applied to the
            professional prophets, and which at least showed them to be men
            of a different spirit from the few who were <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“full of power by the spirit of the Lord, and of
            judgment, and of might, to declare to Israel his sin”</span>
            (Mic. iii. 8). In two graphic figures Ezekiel sums up the
            character and policy of these parasites who disgraced the order
            to which they belonged. In the first place he compares them to
            jackals burrowing in ruins and undermining the fabric which it
            was their professed function to uphold (vv. 4, 5). The existence
            of such a class of men is at once a symptom of advanced social
            degeneration and a cause of greater ruin to follow. A true
            prophet fearlessly speaking the words of God is a defence to the
            state; he is like a man who stands in the breach or builds a wall
            to ward off the danger which he foresees. Such were all genuine
            prophets whose names were held in honour in Israel—men of moral
            courage, never hesitating to incur personal risk for the welfare
            of the nation they loved. If Israel now was like a heap of ruins,
            the fault lay with the selfish crowd of hireling prophets who had
            cared more to find a hole in which they could shelter themselves
            than to build up a stable and righteous polity.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The prophet's
            simile calls to mind the type of churchman represented by Bishop
            Blougram in Browning's powerful satire. He is one who is content
            if the corporation to which he belongs can provide him with a
            comfortable and dignified position in which he can spend good
            days; he is triumphant if, in addition to this, he can defy any
            one to prove him more of a fool or a hypocrite than an average
            man of the world. Such utter abnegation of intellectual sincerity
            may not be common in any Church; <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page121">[pg 121]</span><a name="Pg121" id="Pg121" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> but the temptation which leads to it is one
            to which ecclesiastics are exposed in every age and every
            communion. The tendency to shirk difficult problems, to shut
            one's eyes to grave evils, to acquiesce in things as they are,
            and calculate that the ruin will last one's own time, is what
            Ezekiel calls playing the jackal; and it hardly needs a prophet
            to tell us that there could not be a more fatal symptom of the
            decay of religion than the prevalence of such a spirit in its
            official representatives.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The second
            image is equally suggestive. It exhibits the false prophets as
            following where they pretended to lead, as aiding and abetting
            the men into whose hands the reins of government had fallen. The
            people build a wall and the prophets cover it with plaster (ver.
            10)—that is to say, when any project or scheme of policy is being
            promoted they stand by glozing it over with fine words,
            flattering its promoters, and uttering profuse assurances of its
            success. The uselessness of the whole activity of these prophets
            could not be more vividly described. The white-washing of the
            wall may hide its defects, but will not prevent its destruction;
            and when the wall of Jerusalem's shaky prosperity tumbles down,
            those who did so little to build and so much to deceive shall be
            overwhelmed with confusion. <span class="tei tei-q">“Behold, when
            the wall is fallen, shall it not be said to them, Where is the
            plaster which ye plastered?”</span> (ver. 12).</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This will be
            the beginning of the judgment on false prophets in Israel. The
            overthrow of their vaticinations, the collapse of the hopes they
            fostered, and the demolition of the edifice in which they found a
            refuge shall leave them no more a name or a place in the people
            of God. <span class="tei tei-q">“I will stretch out My hand
            against the prophets that see vanity and divine falsely: in the
            council of My people they shall not be, and in the register of
            the house of Israel they shall not be written, and into the land
            of Israel they shall not come”</span> (ver. 9).</p><span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page122">[pg 122]</span><a name="Pg122" id=
            "Pg122" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was,
            however, a still more degraded type of prophecy, practised
            chiefly by women, which must have been exceedingly prevalent in
            Ezekiel's time. The prophets spoken of in the first sixteen
            verses were public functionaries who exerted their evil influence
            in the arena of politics. The prophetesses spoken of in the
            latter part of the chapter are private fortune-tellers who
            practised on the credulity of individuals who consulted them.
            Their art was evidently magical in the strict sense, a
            trafficking with the dark powers which were supposed to enter
            into alliance with men irrespective of moral considerations.
            Then, as now, such courses were followed for gain, and doubtless
            proved a lucrative means of livelihood. The <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“fillets”</span> and <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“veils”</span> mentioned in ver. 18 are either a
            professional garb worn by the women, or else implements of
            divination whose precise significance cannot now be ascertained.
            To the imagination of the prophet they appear as the snares and
            weapons with which these wretched creatures <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“hunted souls”</span>; and the extent of the evil
            which he attacks is indicated by his speaking of the whole people
            as being entangled in their meshes. Ezekiel naturally bestows
            special attention on a class of practitioners whose whole
            influence tended to efface moral landmarks and to deal out to men
            weal or woe without regard to character. <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“They slew souls that should not die, and saved alive
            souls that should not live; they made sad the heart of the
            righteous, and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he
            should not return from his wicked way and be saved alive”</span>
            (ver. 22). That is to say, while Ezekiel and all true prophets
            were exhorting men to live resolutely in the light of clear
            ethical conceptions of providence, the votaries of occult
            superstitions seduced the ignorant into making private compacts
            with the powers of darkness in order to secure their personal
            safety. If the prevalence of sorcery and <span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page123">[pg 123]</span><a name="Pg123" id="Pg123" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> witchcraft was at all times dangerous to
            the religion and public order of the state, it was doubly so at a
            time when, as Ezekiel perceived, everything depended on
            maintaining the strict rectitude of God in His dealings with
            individual men.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Having thus
            disposed of the external manifestations of false prophecy,
            Ezekiel proceeds in the fourteenth chapter to deal with the state
            of mind amongst the people at large which rendered such a
            condition of things possible. The general import of the passage
            is clear, although the precise connection of ideas is somewhat
            difficult to explain. The following observations may suffice to
            bring out all that is essential to the understanding of the
            section.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The oracle was
            occasioned by a particular incident, undoubtedly
            historical—namely, a visit, such as was perhaps now common, from
            the elders to inquire of the Lord through Ezekiel. As they sit
            before him it is revealed to the prophet that the minds of these
            men are preoccupied with idolatry, and therefore it is not
            fitting that any answer should be given to them by a prophet of
            Jehovah. Apparently no answer <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">was</span></em>
            given by Ezekiel to the particular question they had asked,
            whatever it may have been. Generalising from the incident,
            however, he is led to enunciate a principle regulating the
            intercourse between Jehovah and Israel through the medium of a
            prophet: <span class="tei tei-q">“Whatever man of the house of
            Israel sets his thoughts upon his idols, and puts his guilty
            stumbling-block before him, and comes to the prophet, I Jehovah
            will make Myself intelligible to him;<a id="noteref_39" name=
            "noteref_39" href="#note_39"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

            I may take <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page124">[pg

            the house of Israel in their own heart, because they are all
            estranged from Me by their idols”</span> (vv. 4, 5). It seems
            clear that one part of the threat here uttered is that the very
            withholding of the answer will unmask the hypocrisy of men who
            pretend to be worshippers of Jehovah, but in heart are unfaithful
            to Him and servants of false gods. The moral principle involved
            in the prophet's dictum is clear and of lasting value. It is that
            for a false heart there can be no fellowship with Jehovah, and
            therefore no true and sure knowledge of His will. The prophet
            occupies the point of view of Jehovah, and when consulted by an
            idolater he finds it impossible to enter into the point of view
            from which the question is put, and therefore cannot answer
            it.<a id="noteref_40" name="noteref_40" href=

            Ezekiel assumes for the most part that the prophet consulted is a
            true prophet of Jehovah like himself, who will give no answer to
            such questions as he has before him. He must, however, allow for
            the possibility that men of this stamp may receive answers in the
            name of Jehovah from those reputed to be His true prophets. In
            that case, says Ezekiel, the prophet is <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“deceived”</span> by God; he is allowed to give a
            response which is not a true response at all, but only confirms
            the people in their delusions and unbelief. But this deception
            does not take place until the prophet has incurred the guilt of
            deceiving himself in the first instance. It is his fault that he
            has not perceived the bent of his questioners' minds, that he has
            accommodated himself to their ways of thought, has consented to
            occupy their standpoint in order to be able to say something
            coinciding with the drift of their wishes. Prophet and inquirers
            are involved in a common guilt and share a common fate, both
            being sentenced to exclusion from the commonwealth of
            Israel.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page125">[pg

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
            purification of the institution of prophecy necessarily appeared
            to Ezekiel as an indispensable feature in the restoration of the
            theocracy. The ideal of Israel's relation to Jehovah is
            <span class="tei tei-q">“that they may be My people, and that I
            may be their God”</span> (ver. 11). That implies that Jehovah
            shall be the source of infallible guidance in all things needful
            for the religious life of the individual and the guidance of the
            state. But it was impossible for Jehovah to be to Israel all that
            a God should be, so long as the regular channels of communication
            between Him and the nation were choked by false conceptions in
            the minds of the people and false men in the position of
            prophets. Hence the constitution of a new Israel demands such
            special judgments on false prophecy and the false use of true
            prophecy as have been denounced in these chapters. When these
            judgments have been executed, the ideal will have become possible
            which is described in the words of another prophet: <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Thine eyes shall see thy teachers: and thine ears
            shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye
            in it”</span> (Isa. xxx. 20, 21).</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In order to
          understand the place which the sixteenth chapter occupies in this

          "#note_41"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">41</span></span></a> of the
          book, we must remember that a chief source of the antagonism
          between Ezekiel and his hearers was the proud national
          consciousness which sustained the courage of the people through all
          their humiliations. There were, perhaps, few nations of antiquity
          in which the flame of patriotic feeling burned more brightly than
          in Israel. No people with a past such as theirs could be
          indifferent to the many elements of greatness embalmed in their
          history. The beauty and fertility of their land, the martial
          exploits and signal deliverances of the nation, the great kings and
          heroes she had reared, her prophets and lawgivers—these and many
          other stirring memories were witnesses to Jehovah's peculiar love
          for Israel and His power to exalt and bless His people. To cherish
          a deep sense of the unique privileges which Jehovah had conferred
          on her in giving her a distinct place among the nations of the
          earth was thus a religious duty often insisted on in the Old
          Testament. But in order that this sense might work for good it was
          necessary that it should take the form of grateful recognition of
          Jehovah as the source of the nation's greatness, and be accompanied
          by a true knowledge of His character. When allied with false
          conceptions of Jehovah's <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page127">[pg
          127]</span><a name="Pg127" id="Pg127" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          nature, or entirely divorced from religion, patriotism degenerated
          into racial prejudice and became a serious moral and political
          danger. That this had actually taken place is a common complaint of
          the prophets. They feel that national vanity is a great obstacle to
          the acceptance of their message, and pour forth bitter and scornful
          words intended to humble the pride of Israel to the dust. No
          prophet addresses himself to the task so remorselessly as Ezekiel.
          The utter worthlessness of Israel, both absolutely in the eyes of
          Jehovah and relatively in comparison with other nations, is
          asserted by him with a boldness and emphasis which at first startle
          us. From a different point of view prophecy and its results might
          have been regarded as fruits of the national life, under the divine
          education vouchsafed to that people. But that is not Ezekiel's
          standpoint. He seizes on the fact that prophecy was in opposition
          to the natural genius of the people, and was not to be regarded as
          in any sense an expression of it. Accepting the final attitude of
          Israel toward the word of Jehovah as the genuine outcome of her
          natural proclivities, he reads her past as an unbroken record of
          ingratitude and infidelity. All that was good in Israel was
          Jehovah's gift, freely bestowed and justly withdrawn; all that was
          Israel's own was her weakness and her sin. It was reserved for a
          later prophet to reconcile the condemnation of Israel's actual
          history with the recognition of the divine power working there and
          moulding a spiritual kernel of the nation into a true <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“servant of the Lord”</span> (Isa. xl. ff.).</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In chs. xv. and
          xvi., therefore, the prophet exposes the hollowness of Israel's
          confidence in her national destiny. The first of these appears to
          be directed against the vain hopes cherished in Jerusalem at the
          time. It is not necessary to dwell on it at length. The image is
          simple and its application to Jerusalem obvious. Earlier
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page128">[pg 128]</span><a name=
          "Pg128" id="Pg128" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> prophets had
          compared Israel to a vine, partly to set forth the exceptional
          privileges she enjoyed, but chiefly to emphasise the degeneration
          she had undergone, as shown by the bad moral fruits which she had
          borne (cf. Isa. v. 1 ff.; Jer. ii. 21; Hos. x. 1). The popular
          imagination had laid hold of the thought that Israel was the vine
          of God's planting, ignoring the question of the fruit. But Ezekiel
          reminds his hearers that apart from its fruit the vine is the most
          worthless of trees. Even at the best its wood can be employed for
          no useful purpose; it is fit only for fuel. Such was the people of
          Israel, considered simply as a state among other states, without
          regard to its religious vocation. Even in its pristine vigour, when
          the national energies were fresh and unimpaired, it was but a weak
          nation, incapable of attaining the dignity of a great power. But
          now the strength of the nation has been worn away by a long
          succession of disasters, until only a shadow of her former glory
          remains. Israel is no longer like a green and living vine, but like
          a branch burned at both ends and charred in the middle, and
          therefore doubly unfit for any worthy function in the affairs of
          the world. By the help of this illustration men may read in the
          present state of the nation the irrevocable sentence of rejection
          which Jehovah has passed on His people.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We now turn to
          the striking allegory of ch. xvi., where the same subject is
          treated with far greater penetration and depth of feeling. There is
          no passage in the book of Ezekiel at once so powerful and so full
          of religious significance as the picture of Jerusalem, the
          foundling child, the unfaithful spouse, and the abandoned
          prostitute, which is here presented. The general conception is one
          that might have been presented in a form as beautiful as it is
          spiritually true. But the features which offend our sense of
          propriety are perhaps introduced with a stern purpose. It is the
          deliberate intention of Ezekiel to <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page129">[pg 129]</span><a name="Pg129" id="Pg129" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> present Jerusalem's wickedness in the most
          repulsive light, in order that if possible he might startle men
          into abhorrence of their national sin. In his own mind the feelings
          of moral indignation and physical disgust were very close together,
          and here he seems to work on the minds of his readers, so that the
          feeling excited by the image may call forth the feeling appropriate
          to the reality.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The allegory is
          a highly idealised history of the city of Jerusalem from its origin
          to its destruction, and then onward to its future restoration. It
          falls naturally into four divisions:—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">i. Vv. 1-14.—The
          first emergence of Jerusalem into civic life is compared to a
          new-born female infant, exposed to perish, after a cruel custom
          which is known to have prevailed among some Semitic tribes. None of
          the offices customary on the birth of a child were performed in her
          case, whether those necessary to preserve life or those which had a
          merely ceremonial significance. Unblessed and unpitied she lay in
          the open field, weltering in blood, exciting only repugnance in all
          who passed by, until Jehovah Himself passed by, and pronounced over
          her the decree that she should live. Thus saved from death, she
          grew up and reached maturity, but still <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“naked and bare,”</span> destitute of wealth and the
          refinements of civilisation. These were bestowed on her when a
          second time Jehovah passed by and spread His skirt over her, and
          claimed her for His own. Not till then had she been treated as a
          human being, with the possibilities of honourable life before her.
          But now she becomes the bride of her protector, and is provided for
          as a high-born maiden might be, with all the ornaments and luxuries
          befitting her new rank. Lifted from the lowest depth of
          degradation, she is now transcendently beautiful, and has
          <span class="tei tei-q">“attained to royal estate.”</span> The fame
          of her loveliness went abroad <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page130">[pg 130]</span><a name="Pg130" id="Pg130" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> among the nations: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“for it was perfect through My glory, which I put upon
          thee, saith Jehovah”</span> (ver. 14).</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It will be seen
          that the points of contact with actual history are here extremely
          few as well as vague. It is indeed doubtful whether the subject of
          the allegory be the city of Jerusalem conceived as one through all
          its changes of population, or the Hebrew nation of which Jerusalem
          ultimately became the capital. The latter interpretation is
          certainly favoured by ch. xxiii., where both Jerusalem and Samaria
          are represented as having spent their youth in Egypt. That parallel
          may not be decisive as to the meaning of ch. xvi.; and the
          statement <span class="tei tei-q">“thy father was the Amorite and
          thy mother an Hittite”</span> may be thought to support the other
          alternative. Amorite and Hittite are general names for the
          pre-Israelite population of Canaan, and it is a well-known fact
          that Jerusalem was originally a Canaanitish city. It is not
          necessary to suppose that the prophet has any information about the
          early fortunes of Jerusalem when he describes the stages of the
          process by which she was raised to royal magnificence. The chief
          question is whether these details can be fairly applied to the
          history of the nation before it had Jerusalem as its metropolis. It
          is usually held that the first <span class="tei tei-q">“passing
          by”</span> of Jehovah refers to the preservation of the people in
          the patriarchal period, and the second to the events of the Exodus
          and the Sinaitic covenant. Against this it may be urged that
          Ezekiel would hardly have presented the patriarchal period in a
          hateful light, although he does go further in discrediting
          antiquity than any other prophet. Besides, the description of
          Jerusalem's betrothal to Jehovah contains points which are more
          naturally understood of the glories of the age of David and Solomon
          than of the events of Sinai, which were not accompanied by an
          access of material prosperity such as is suggested. It may be
          necessary to leave the matter in the vagueness with which
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page131">[pg 131]</span><a name=
          "Pg131" id="Pg131" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the prophet has
          surrounded it, and accept as the teaching of the allegory the
          simple truth that Jerusalem in herself was nothing, but had been
          preserved in existence by Jehovah's will, and owed all her
          splendour to her association with His cause and His kingdom.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">ii. Vv.
          15-34.—The dainties and rich attire enjoyed by the highly favoured
          bride become a snare to her. These represent blessings of a
          material order bestowed by Jehovah on Jerusalem. Throughout the
          chapter nothing is said of the imparting of spiritual privileges,
          or of a moral change wrought in the heart of Jerusalem. The gifts
          of Jehovah are conferred on one incapable of responding to the care
          and affection that had been lavished on her. The inborn taint of
          her nature, the hereditary immorality of her heathen ancestors,
          breaks out in a career of licentiousness in which all the
          advantages of her proud position are prostituted to the vilest
          ends. <span class="tei tei-q">“As is the mother, so is her
          daughter”</span> (ver. 44); and Jerusalem betrayed her true origin
          by the readiness with which she took to evil courses as soon as she
          had the opportunity. The <span class="tei tei-q">“whoredom”</span>
          in which the prophet sums up his indictment against his people is
          chiefly the sin of idolatry. The figure may have been suggested by
          the fact that actual lewdness of the most flagrant kind was a
          conspicuous element in the form of idolatry to which Israel first
          succumbed—the worship of the Canaanite Baals. But in the hands of
          the prophets it has a deeper and more spiritual import than this.
          It signified the violation of all the sacred moral obligations
          which are enshrined in human marriage, or, in other words, the
          abandonment of an ethical religion for one in which the powers of
          nature were regarded as the highest revelation of the divine. To
          the mind of the prophet it made no difference whether the object of
          worship was called by the name of Jehovah or of Baal: the character
          of the worship determined the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page132">[pg 132]</span><a name="Pg132" id="Pg132" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> quality of the religion; and in the one case,
          as in the other, it was idolatry, or <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“whoredom.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Two stages in
          the idolatry of Israel appear to be distinguished in this part of
          the chapter. The first is the naïve, half-conscious heathenism
          which crept in insensibly through contact with Phœnician and
          Canaanite neighbours (vv. 15-25). The tokens of Jerusalem's
          implication in this sin were everywhere. The <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“high places”</span> with their tents and clothed
          images (ver. 17), and the offerings set forth before these objects
          of adoration, were undoubtedly of Canaanitish origin, and their
          preservation to the fall of the kingdom was a standing witness to
          the source to which Israel owed her earliest and dearest
          <span class="tei tei-q">“abominations.”</span> We learn that this
          phase of idolatry culminated in the atrocious rite of human
          sacrifice (vv. 20, 21). The immolation of children to Baal or
          Molech was a common practice amongst the nations surrounding
          Israel, and when introduced there seems to have been regarded as
          part of the worship of Jehovah.<a id="noteref_42" name="noteref_42"
          href="#note_42"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">42</span></span></a> What
          Ezekiel here asserts is that the practice came through Israel's
          illicit commerce with the gods of Canaan, and there is no question
          that this is historically true. The allegory exhibits the sin in
          its unnatural heinousness. The idealised city is the mother of her
          citizens, the children are Jehovah's children and her own, yet she
          has taken them and offered them up to the false lovers she so madly
          pursued. Such was her feverish passion for idolatry that the
          dearest and most sacred ties of nature were ruthlessly severed at
          the bidding of a perverted religious sense.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The second form
          of idolatry in Israel was of a more deliberate and politic kind
          (vv. 23-34). It consisted in the introduction of the deities and
          religious practices of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page133">[pg 133]</span><a name="Pg133" id="Pg133" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> great world-powers—Egypt, Assyria, and
          Chaldæa. The attraction of these foreign rites did not lie in the
          fascination of a sensuous type of religion, but rather in the
          impression of power produced by the gods of the conquering peoples.
          The foreign gods came in mostly in consequence of a political
          alliance with the nations whose patrons they were; in other cases a
          god was worshipped simply because he had shown himself able to do
          great things for his servants. Jerusalem as Ezekiel knew it was
          full of monuments of this comparatively recent type of idolatry. In
          every street and at the head of every way there were erections
          (here called <span class="tei tei-q">“arches”</span> or
          <span class="tei tei-q">“heights”</span>) which, from the
          connection in which they are mentioned, must have been shrines
          devoted to the strange gods from abroad. It is characteristic of
          the political idolatry here referred to that its monuments were
          found in the capital, while the more ancient and rustic worship was
          typified by the <span class="tei tei-q">“high places”</span>
          throughout the provinces. It is probable that the description
          applies mainly to the later period of the monarchy, when Israel,
          and especially Judah, began to lean for support on one or other of
          the great empires on either side of her. At the same time it must
          be remembered that Ezekiel elsewhere teaches distinctly that the
          influence of Egyptian religion had been continuous from the days of
          the Exodus (ch. xxiii.). There may, however, have been a revival of
          Egyptian influence, due to the political exigencies which arose in
          the eighth century.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus Jerusalem
          has <span class="tei tei-q">“played the harlot”</span>; nay, she
          has done worse—<span class="tei tei-q">“she has been as a wife that
          committeth adultery, who though under her husband taketh
          strangers.”</span><a id="noteref_43" name="noteref_43" href=

          the result has been simply the impoverishment of the land. The

          to her lovers to come to her. If false religion had resulted in an
          increase of wealth or material prosperity, there might have been
          some excuse for the eagerness with which she plunged into it. But
          certainly Israel's history bore the lesson that false religion
          means waste and ruin. Strangers had devoured her strength from her
          youth, yet she never would heed the voice of her prophets when they
          sought to guide her into the ways of peace. Her infatuation was
          unnatural; it goes almost beyond the bounds of the allegory to
          exhibit it: <span class="tei tei-q">“The contrary is in thee from
          other women, in that thou committest whoredoms, and none goeth
          awhoring after thee: and in that thou givest hire, and no hire is
          given to thee, therefore thou art contrary”</span> (ver. 34).</p>

          35-58.—Having thus made Jerusalem to <span class="tei tei-q">“know
          her abominations”</span> (ver. 2), the prophet proceeds to announce
          the doom which must inevitably follow such a career of wickedness.
          The figures under which the judgment is set forth appear to be
          taken from the punishment meted out to profligate women in ancient
          Israel. The public exposure of the adulteress and her death by
          stoning in the presence of <span class="tei tei-q">“many
          women”</span> supply images terribly appropriate of the fate in
          store for Jerusalem.<a id="noteref_44" name="noteref_44" href=

          punishment is to be a warning to all surrounding nations, and an
          exhibition of the jealous wrath of Jehovah against her infidelity.
          These nations, some of them hereditary enemies, others old allies,
          are represented as assembled to witness and to execute the judgment
          of the city. The remorseless realism of the prophet spares no
          detail which <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page135">[pg
          135]</span><a name="Pg135" id="Pg135" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          could enhance the horror of the situation. Abandoned to the
          ruthless violence of her former lovers, Jerusalem is stripped of
          her royal attire, the emblems of her idolatry are destroyed, and
          so, left naked to her enemies, she suffers the ignominious death of
          a city that has been false to her religion. The root of her sin had
          been the forgetfulness of what she owed to the goodness of Jehovah,
          and the essence of her punishment lies in the withdrawal of the
          gifts He had lavished upon her and the protection which amid all
          her apostasies she had never ceased to expect.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At this point
          (ver. 44 ff.) the allegory takes a new turn through the
          introduction of the sister cities of Samaria and Sodom. Samaria,
          although as a city much younger than Jerusalem, is considered the
          elder sister because she had once been the centre of a greater
          political power than Jerusalem, and Sodom, which was probably older
          than either, is treated as the youngest because of her relative
          insignificance. The order, however, is of no importance. The point
          of the comparison is that all three had manifested in different
          degrees the same hereditary tendency to immorality (ver. 45). All
          three were of heathen origin—their mother a Hittite and their
          father an Amorite—a description which it is even more difficult to
          understand in the case of Samaria than in that of Jerusalem. But
          Ezekiel is not concerned about history. What is prominent in his
          mind is the family likeness observed in their characters, which
          gave point to the proverb <span class="tei tei-q">“Like mother,
          like daughter”</span> when applied to Jerusalem. The prophet
          affirms that the wickedness of Jerusalem had so far exceeded that
          of Samaria and Sodom that she had <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“justified”</span> her sisters—<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          she had made their moral condition appear pardonable by comparison
          with hers. He knows that he is saying a bold thing in ranking the
          iniquity of Jerusalem as greater than that of Sodom, and so he
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page136">[pg 136]</span><a name=
          "Pg136" id="Pg136" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> explains his
          judgment on Sodom by an analysis of the cause of her notorious
          corruptness. The name of Sodom lived in tradition as that of the
          foulest city of the old world, a <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">ne plus
          ultra</span></span> of wickedness. Yet Ezekiel dares to raise the
          question, What <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">was</span></em> the sin of Sodom? <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“This was the sin of Sodom thy sister, pride,
          superabundance of food, and careless ease was the lot of her and
          her daughters, but they did not succour the poor and needy. But
          they became proud, and committed abominations before Me: therefore
          I took them away as thou hast seen”</span> (vv. 49, 50). The
          meaning seems to be that the corruptions of Sodom were the natural
          outcome of the evil principle in the Canaanitish nature, favoured
          by easy circumstances and unchecked by the saving influences of a
          pure religion. Ezekiel's judgment is like an anticipation of the
          more solemn sentence uttered by One who knew what was in man when
          He said, <span class="tei tei-q">“If the mighty works which have
          been done in you had been done in Sodom and Gomorrha, they would
          have remained until this day.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is remarkable
          to observe how some of the profoundest ideas in this chapter attach
          themselves to the strange conception of these two vanished cities
          as still capable of being restored to their place in the world. In
          the ideal future of the prophet's vision Sodom and Samaria shall
          rise from their ruins through the same power which restores
          Jerusalem to her ancient glory. The promise of a renewed existence
          to Sodom and Samaria is perhaps connected with the fact that they
          lay within the sacred territory of which Jerusalem is the centre.
          Hence Sodom and Samaria are no longer sisters, but daughters of
          Jerusalem, receiving through her the blessings of the true
          religion. And it is her relation to these her sisters that opens
          the eyes of Jerusalem to the true nature of her own relation to
          Jehovah. Formerly she had been proud and <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page137">[pg 137]</span><a name="Pg137" id="Pg137" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> self-sufficient, and counted her exceptional
          prerogatives the natural reward of some excellence to which she
          could lay claim. The name of Sodom, the disgraced sister of the
          family, was not heard in her mouth in the days of her pride, when
          her wickedness had not been disclosed as it is now (ver. 57). But
          when she realises that her conduct has justified and comforted her
          sister, and when she has to take guilty Sodom to her heart as a
          daughter, she will understand that she owes all her greatness to
          the same sovereign grace of Jehovah which is manifested in the
          restoration of the most abandoned community known to history. And
          out of this new consciousness of grace will spring the chastened
          and penitent temper of mind which makes possible the continuance of
          the bond which unites her to Jehovah.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">iv. Vv.
          59-63.—The way is thus prepared for the final promise of
          forgiveness with which the chapter closes. The reconciliation
          between Jehovah and Jerusalem will be effected by an act of
          recollection on both sides: <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">I</span></em> will
          remember My covenant with thee.... <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Thou</span></em>
          shalt remember thy ways”</span> (vv. 60, 61). The mind of Jehovah
          and the mind of Jerusalem both go back on the past; but while
          Jehovah thinks only of the purpose of love which he had entertained
          towards Jerusalem in the days of her youth and the indissoluble
          bond between them, Jerusalem retains the memory of her own sinful
          history, and finds in the remembrance the source of abiding
          contrition and shame. It does not fall within the scope of the
          prophet's purpose to set forth in this place the blessed
          consequences which flow from this renewal of loving intercourse
          between Israel and her God. He has accomplished his object when he
          has shown how the electing love of Jehovah reaches its end in spite
          of human sin and rebellion, and how through the crushing power of
          divine grace the failures and transgressions of the past are
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page138">[pg 138]</span><a name=
          "Pg138" id="Pg138" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> made to issue in a
          relation of perfect harmony between Jehovah and His people. The
          permanence of that relation is expressed by an idea borrowed from
          Jeremiah—the idea of an everlasting covenant, which cannot be
          broken because based on the forgiveness of sin and a renewal of
          heart. The prophet knows that when once the power of evil has been
          broken by a full disclosure of redeeming love it cannot resume its
          old ascendency in human life. So he leaves us on the threshold of
          the new dispensation with the picture of Jerusalem humbled and
          bearing her shame, yet in the abjectness of her self-accusation
          realising the end towards which the love of Jehovah had guided her
          from the beginning: <span class="tei tei-q">“I will establish My
          covenant with thee; and thou shalt know that I am Jehovah: that
          thou mayest remember, and be ashamed, and not open thy mouth any
          more for very shame, when I expiate for thee all that thou hast
          done, saith the Lord Jehovah”</span> (vv. 62, 63).</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Throughout this
          chapter we see that the prophet moves in the region of national
          religious ideas which are distinctive of the Old Testament. Of the
          influences that formed his conceptions that of Hosea is perhaps
          most discernible. The fundamental thoughts embodied in the allegory
          are the same as those by which the older prophet learned to
          interpret the nature of God and the sin of Israel through the
          bitter experiences of his family life. These thoughts are developed
          by Ezekiel with a fertility of imagination and a grasp of
          theological principles which were adapted to the more complex
          situation with which he had to deal. But the conception of Israel
          as the unfaithful wife of Jehovah, of the false gods and the
          world-powers as her lovers, of her conversion through affliction,
          and her final restoration by a new betrothal which is eternal, are
          all expressed in the first three chapters of Hosea. And the freedom
          with which Ezekiel handles and expands these <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page139">[pg 139]</span><a name="Pg139" id="Pg139"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> conceptions shows how thoroughly he was
          at home in that national view of religion which he did much to
          break through. In the next lecture we shall have occasion to
          examine his treatment of the problem of the individual's relation
          to God, and we cannot fail to be struck by the contrast. The
          analysis of individual religion may seem meagre by the side of this
          most profound and suggestive chapter. This arises from the fact
          that the full meaning of religion could not then be expressed as an
          experience of the individual soul. The subject of religion being
          the nation of Israel, the human side of it could only be unfolded
          in terms of what we should call the national consciousness. The
          time was not yet come when the great truths which the prophets and
          psalmists saw embodied in the history of their people could be
          translated in terms of individual fellowship with God. Yet the God
          who spake to the fathers by the prophets is the same who has spoken
          to us in His Son; and when from the standpoint of a higher
          revelation we turn back to the Old Testament, it is to find in the
          form of a nation's history the very same truths which we realise as
          matters of personal experience.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From this point
          of view the chapter we have considered is one of the most
          evangelical passages in the writings of Ezekiel. The prophet's
          conception of sin, for example, is singularly profound and true. He
          has been charged with a somewhat superficial conception of sin, as
          if he saw nothing more in it than the transgression of a law
          arbitrarily imposed by divine authority. There are aspects of
          Ezekiel's teaching which give some plausibility to that charge,
          especially those which deal with the duties of the individual. But
          we see that to Ezekiel the real nature of sin could not possibly be
          manifested except as a factor in the national life. Now in this
          allegory it is obvious that he sees something far deeper in it than
          the mere transgression of positive commandments. Behind all the
          outward <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page140">[pg
          140]</span><a name="Pg140" id="Pg140" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          offences of which Israel had been guilty there plainly lies the
          spiritual fact of national selfishness, unfaithfulness to Jehovah,
          insensibility to His love, and ingratitude for His benefits.
          Moreover, the prophet, like Jeremiah before him, has a strong sense
          of sin as a tendency in human life, a power which is ineradicable
          save by the mingled severity and goodness of God. Through the whole
          history of Israel it is one evil disposition which he sees
          asserting itself, breaking out now in one form and then in another,
          but continually gaining strength, until at last the spirit of
          repentance is created by the experience of God's forgiveness. It is
          not the case, therefore, that Ezekiel failed to comprehend the
          nature of sin, or that in this respect he falls below the most
          spiritual of the prophets who had gone before him.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In order that
          this tendency to sin may be destroyed, Ezekiel sees that the
          consciousness of guilt must take its place. In the same way the
          apostle Paul teaches that <span class="tei tei-q">“every mouth must
          be stopped, and all the world become guilty before God.”</span>
          Whether the subject be a nation or an individual, the dominion of
          sin is not broken till the sinner has taken home to himself the
          full responsibility for his acts and felt himself to be
          <span class="tei tei-q">“without excuse.”</span> But the most
          striking thing in Ezekiel's representation of the process of
          conversion is the thought that this saving sense of sin is produced
          less by judgment than by free and undeserved forgiveness.
          Punishment he conceives to be necessary, being demanded alike by
          the righteousness of God and the good of the sinful people. But the
          heart of Jerusalem is not changed till she finds herself restored
          to her former relation to God, with all the sin of her past blotted
          out and a new life before her. It is through the grace of
          forgiveness that she is overwhelmed with shame and sorrow for sin,
          and learns the humility which is the germ of a new hope towards
          God. Here the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page141">[pg
          141]</span><a name="Pg141" id="Pg141" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          prophet strikes one of the deepest notes of evangelical doctrine.
          All experience confirms the lesson that true repentance is not
          produced by the terrors of the law, but by the view of God's love
          in Christ going forth to meet the sinner and bring him back to the
          Father's heart and home.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another question
          of great interest and difficulty is the attitude towards the
          heathen world assumed by Ezekiel. The prophecy of the restoration
          of Sodom is certainly one of the most remarkable things in the
          book. It is true that Ezekiel as a rule concerns himself very
          little with the religious state of the outlying world under the
          Messianic dispensation. Where he speaks of foreign nations it is
          only to announce the manifestation of Jehovah's glory in the
          judgments He executes upon them. The effect of these judgments is
          that <span class="tei tei-q">“they shall know that I am
          Jehovah”</span>; but how much is included in the expression as
          applied to the heathen it is impossible to say. This, however, may
          be due to the peculiar limitation of view which leads him to
          concentrate his attention on the Holy Land in his visions of the
          perfect kingdom of God. We can hardly suppose that he conceived all
          the rest of the world as a blank or filled with a seething mass of
          humanity outside the government of the true God. It is rather to be
          supposed that Canaan itself appeared to his mind as an epitome of
          the world such as it must be when the latter-day glory was ushered
          in. And in Canaan he finds room for Sodom, but Sodom turned to the
          knowledge of the true God and sharing in the blessings bestowed on
          Jerusalem. It is surely allowable to see in this the symptom of a
          more hopeful view of the future of the world at large than we
          should gather from the rest of the prophecy. If Ezekiel could think
          of Sodom as raised from the dead and sharing the glories of the
          people of God, the idea of the conversion of heathen nations
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page142">[pg 142]</span><a name=
          "Pg142" id="Pg142" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> could not have been
          altogether foreign to his mind. It is at all events significant
          that when he meditates most profoundly on the nature of sin and
          God's method of dealing with it, he is led to the thought of a
          divine mercy which embraces in its sweep those communities which
          had reached the lowest depths of moral corruption.</p>

          Individual. Chapter xviii.</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the sixteenth
          chapter, as we have seen, Ezekiel has asserted in the most
          unqualified terms the validity of the principle of national
          retribution. The nation is dealt with as a moral unity, and the
          catastrophe which closes its history is the punishment for the
          accumulated guilt incurred by the past generations. In the
          eighteenth chapter he teaches still more explicitly the freedom and
          the independent responsibility of each individual before God. No
          attempt is made to reconcile the two principles as methods of the
          divine government; from the prophet's standpoint they do not
          require to be reconciled. They belong to different dispensations.
          So long as the Jewish state existed the principle of solidarity
          remained in force. Men suffered for the sins of their ancestors;
          individuals shared the punishment incurred by the nation as a
          whole. But as soon as the nation is dead, when the bonds that unite
          men in the organism of national life are dissolved, then the idea
          of individual responsibility comes into immediate operation. Each
          Israelite stands isolated before Jehovah, the burden of hereditary
          guilt falls away from him, and he is free to determine his own
          relation to God. He need not fear that the iniquity of his fathers
          will be reckoned against him; he is held accountable only for his
          own sins, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page144">[pg
          144]</span><a name="Pg144" id="Pg144" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          these can be forgiven on the condition of his own repentance.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The doctrine of
          this chapter is generally regarded as Ezekiel's most characteristic
          contribution to theology. It might be nearer the truth to say that
          he is dealing with one of the great religious problems of the age
          in which he lived. The difficulty was perceived by Jeremiah, and
          treated in a manner which shows that his thoughts were being led in
          the same direction as those of Ezekiel (Jer. xxxi. 29, 30). If in
          any respect the teaching of Ezekiel makes an advance on that of
          Jeremiah, it is in his application of the new truth to the duty of
          the present: and even here the difference is more apparent than
          real. Jeremiah postpones the introduction of personal religion to
          the future, regarding it as an ideal to be realised in the
          Messianic age. His own life and that of his contemporaries was
          bound up with the old dispensation which was passing away, and he
          knew that he was destined to share the fate of his people. Ezekiel,
          on the other hand, lives already under the powers of the world to
          come. The one hindrance to the perfect manifestation of Jehovah's
          righteousness has been removed by the destruction of Jerusalem, and
          henceforward it will be made apparent in the correspondence between
          the desert and the fate of each individual. The new Israel must be
          organised on the basis of personal religion, and the time has
          already come when the task of preparing the religious community of
          the future must be earnestly taken up. Hence the doctrine of
          individual responsibility has a peculiar and practical importance
          in the mission of Ezekiel. The call to repentance, which is the
          keynote of his ministry, is addressed to individual men, and in
          order that it may take effect their minds must be disabused of all
          fatalistic preconceptions which would induce paralysis of the moral
          faculties. It was necessary to <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page145">[pg 145]</span><a name="Pg145" id="Pg145" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> affirm in all their breadth and fulness the
          two fundamental truths of personal religion—the absolute
          righteousness of God's dealings with individual men, and His
          readiness to welcome and pardon the penitent.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The eighteenth
          chapter falls accordingly into two divisions. In the first the
          prophet sets the individual's immediate relation to God against the
          idea that guilt is transmitted from father to children (vv. 2-20).
          In the second he tries to dispel the notion that a man's fate is so
          determined by his own past life as to make a change of moral
          condition impossible (vv. 21-32).</p>

            <span style="font-size: 120%">I</span></h3>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is
            noteworthy that both Jeremiah and Ezekiel, in dealing with the
            question of retribution, start from a popular proverb which had
            gained currency in the later years of the kingdom of Judah:
            <span class="tei tei-q">“The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and
            the children's teeth are set on edge.”</span> In whatever spirit
            this saying may have been first coined, there is no doubt that it
            had come to be used as a witticism at the expense of Providence.
            It indicates that influences were at work besides the word of
            prophecy which tended to undermine men's faith in the current
            conception of the divine government. The doctrine of transmitted
            guilt was accepted as a fact of experience, but it no longer
            satisfied the deeper moral instincts of men. In early Israel it
            was otherwise. There the idea that the son should bear the
            iniquity of the father was received without challenge and applied
            without misgiving in judicial procedure. The whole family of
            Achan perished for the sin of their father; the sons of Saul
            expiated their father's crime long after he was dead. These are
            indeed but isolated facts, yet they are sufficient to prove the
            ascendency of the antique <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page146">[pg 146]</span><a name="Pg146" id="Pg146" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> conception of the tribe or family as a
            unity whose individual members are involved in the guilt of the
            head. With the spread of purer ethical ideas among the people
            there came a deeper sense of the value of the individual life,
            and at a later time the principle of vicarious punishment was
            banished from the administration of human justice (cf. 2 Kings
            xiv. 6 with Deut. xxiv. 16). Within that sphere the principle was
            firmly established that each man shall be put to death for his
            own sin. But the motives which made this change intelligible and
            necessary in purely human relations could not be brought to bear
            immediately on the question of divine retribution. The
            righteousness of God was thought to act on different lines from
            the righteousness of man. The experience of the last generation
            of the state seemed to furnish fresh evidence of the operation of
            a law of providence by which men were made to inherit the
            iniquity of their fathers. The literature of the period is filled
            with the conviction that it was the sins of Manasseh that had
            sealed the doom of the nation. These sins had never been
            adequately punished, and subsequent events showed that they were
            not forgiven. The reforming zeal of Josiah had postponed for a
            time the final visitation of Jehovah's anger; but no reformation
            and no repentance could avail to roll back the flood of judgment
            that had been set in motion by the crimes of the reign of
            Manasseh. <span class="tei tei-q">“Notwithstanding Jehovah turned
            not from the fierceness of His great wrath, wherewith His anger
            was kindled against Judah, because of all the provocations that
            Manasseh had provoked Him withal”</span> (2 Kings xxiii. 26).</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The proverb
            about the sour grapes shows the effect of this interpretation of
            providence on a large section of the people. It means no doubt
            that there is an irrational element in God's method of dealing
            with men, something not in harmony with natural laws. In the
            natural sphere if a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page147">[pg
            147]</span><a name="Pg147" id="Pg147" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            man eats sour grapes his own teeth are blunted or set on edge;
            the consequences are immediate, and they are transitory. But in
            the moral sphere a man may eat sour grapes all his life and
            suffer no evil consequences whatever; the consequences, however,
            appear in his children who have committed no such indiscretion.
            There is nothing there which answers to the ordinary sense of
            justice. Yet the proverb appears to be less an arraignment of the
            divine righteousness than a mode of self-exculpation on the part
            of the people. It expresses the fatalism and despair which
            settled down on the minds of that generation when they realised
            the full extent of the calamity that had overtaken them:
            <span class="tei tei-q">“If our transgressions and our sins be
            upon us, and we pine away in them, how then should we
            live?”</span> (ch. xxxiii. 10). So the exiles reasoned in
            Babylon, where they were in no mood for quoting facetious
            proverbs about the ways of Providence; but they accurately
            expressed the sense of the adage that had been current in
            Jerusalem before its fall. The sins for which they suffered were
            not their own, and the judgment that lay on them was no summons
            to repentance, for it was caused by sins of which they were not
            guilty and for which they could not in any real sense repent.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Ezekiel
            attacks this popular theory of retribution at what must have been
            regarded as its strongest point—the relation between the father
            and son. <span class="tei tei-q">“Why should the son <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em>
            bear the iniquity of his father?”</span> the people asked in
            astonishment (ver. 19). <span class="tei tei-q">“It is good
            traditional theology, and it has been confirmed by our own
            experience.”</span> Now Ezekiel would probably not have admitted
            that in any circumstances a son suffers because his father has
            sinned. With that notion he appears to have absolutely broken. He
            did not deny that the Exile was the punishment for all the sins
            of the past as well as for those of the present; but that was
            because the nation was treated as a moral <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page148">[pg 148]</span><a name="Pg148" id=
            "Pg148" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> unity, and not because of any
            law of heredity which bound up the fate of the child with that of
            the father. It was essential to his purpose to show that the
            principle of social guilt or collective retribution came to an
            end with the fall of the state; whereas in the form in which the
            people held to it, it could never come to an end so long as there
            are parents to sin and children to suffer. But the important
            point in the prophet's teaching is that whether in one form or in
            another the principle of solidarity is now superseded. God will
            no longer deal with men in the mass, but as individuals; and
            facts which gave plausibility and a relative justification to
            cynical views of God's providence shall no more occur. There will
            be no more occasion to use that objectionable proverb in Israel.
            On the contrary, it will be manifest in the case of each separate
            individual that God's righteousness is discriminating, and that
            each man's destiny corresponds with his own character. And the
            new principle is embodied in words which may be called the
            charter of the individual soul—words whose significance is fully
            revealed only in Christianity: <span class="tei tei-q">“All souls
            are Mine.... The soul that sinneth, it shall die.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What is here
            asserted is of course not a distinction between the soul or
            spiritual part of man's being and another part of his being which
            is subject to physical necessity, but one between the individual
            and his moral environment. The former distinction is real, and it
            may be necessary for us in our day to insist on it, but it was
            certainly not thought of by Ezekiel or perhaps by any other Old
            Testament writer. The word <span class="tei tei-q">“soul”</span>
            denotes simply the principle of individual life. <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“All persons are Mine”</span> expresses the whole
            meaning which Ezekiel meant to convey. Consequently the death
            threatened to the sinner is not what we call spiritual death, but
            death in the literal sense—the death of the individual. The truth
            taught <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page149">[pg
            149]</span><a name="Pg149" id="Pg149" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            is the independence and freedom of the individual, or his moral
            personality. And that truth involves two things. First, each
            individual belongs to God, stands in immediate personal relation
            to Him. In the old economy the individual belonged to the nation
            or the family, and was related to God only as a member of a
            larger whole. Now he has to deal with God directly—possesses
            independent personal worth in the eye of God. Secondly, as a
            result of this, each man is responsible for his own acts, and for
            these alone. So long as his religious relations are determined by
            circumstances outside of his own life his personality is
            incomplete. The ideal relation to God must be one in which the
            destiny of every man depends on his own free actions. These are
            the fundamental postulates of personal religion as formulated by
            Ezekiel.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first part
            of the chapter is nothing more than an illustration of the second
            of these truths in a sufficient number of instances to show both
            sides of its operation. There is first the case of a man
            perfectly righteous, who as a matter of course lives by his
            righteousness, the state of his father not being taken into
            account. Then this good man is supposed to bear a son who is in
            all respects the opposite of his father, who answers none of the
            tests of a righteous man; he must die for his own sins, and his
            father's righteousness avails him nothing. Lastly, if the son of
            this wicked man takes warning by his father's fate and leads a
            good life, he lives just as the first man did because of his own
            righteousness, and suffers no diminution of his reward because
            his father was a sinner. In all this argument there is a tacit
            appeal to the conscience of the hearers, as if the case only
            required to be put clearly before them to command their assent.
            This is what shall be, the prophet says; and it is what ought to
            be. It is contrary to the idea of perfect justice to conceive of
            Jehovah as acting otherwise than as here represented.
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page150">[pg 150]</span><a name=
            "Pg150" id="Pg150" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> To cling to the
            idea of collective retribution as a permanent truth of religion,
            as the exiles were disposed to do, destroys belief in the divine
            righteousness by making it different from the righteousness which
            expresses itself in the moral judgments of men.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before we pass
            from this part of the chapter we may take note of some
            characteristics of the moral ideal by which Ezekiel tests the
            conduct of the individual man. It is given in the form of a
            catalogue of virtues, the presence or absence of which determines
            a man's fitness or unfitness to enter the future kingdom of God.
            Most of these virtues are defined negatively; the code specifies
            sins to be avoided rather than duties to be performed or graces
            to be cultivated. Nevertheless they are such as to cover a large
            section of human life, and the arrangement of them embodies
            distinctions of permanent ethical significance. They may be
            classed under the three heads of piety, chastity, and
            beneficence. Under the first head, that of directly religious
            duties, two offences are mentioned which are closely connected
            with each other, although to our minds they may seem to involve
            different degrees of guilt (ver. 6). One is the acknowledgment of
            other gods than Jehovah, and the other is participation in
            ceremonies which denoted fellowship with idols.<a id="noteref_45"
            name="noteref_45" href="#note_45"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">45</span></span></a> To
            us who <span class="tei tei-q">“know that an idol is nothing in
            the world”</span> the mere act of eating with the blood has no
            religious significance. But in Ezekiel's time it was impossible
            to divest it of heathen <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page151">[pg
            151]</span><a name="Pg151" id="Pg151" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            associations, and the man who performed it stood convicted of a
            sin against Jehovah. Similarly the idea of sexual purity is
            illustrated by two outstanding and prevalent offences (ver. 6).
            The third head, which includes by far the greater number of
            particulars, deals with the duties which we regard as moral in a
            stricter sense. They are embodiments of the love which
            <span class="tei tei-q">“worketh no ill to his neighbour,”</span>
            and is therefore <span class="tei tei-q">“the fulfilling of the
            law.”</span> It is manifest that the list is not meant to be an
            exhaustive enumeration of all the virtues that a good man must
            practise, or all the vices he must shun. The prophet has before
            his mind two broad classes of men—those who feared God, and those
            who did not; and what he does is to lay down outward marks which
            were practically sufficient to discriminate between the one class
            and the other.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The supreme
            moral category is Righteousness, and this includes the two ideas
            of right character and a right relation to God. The distinction
            between an active righteousness manifested in the life and a
            <span class="tei tei-q">“righteousness which is by faith”</span>
            is not explicitly drawn in the Old Testament. Hence the passage
            contains no teaching on the question whether a man's relation to
            God is determined by his good works, or whether good works are
            the fruit and outcome of a right relation to God. The essence of
            morality, according to the Old Testament, is loyalty to God,
            expressed by obedience to His will; and from that point of view
            it is self-evident that the man who is loyal to Jehovah stands
            accepted in His sight. In other connections Ezekiel makes it
            abundantly clear that the state of grace does not depend on any
            merit which man can have towards God.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The fact that
            Ezekiel defines righteousness in terms of outward conduct has led
            to his being accused of the error of legalism in his moral
            conceptions. He has been <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page152">[pg 152]</span><a name="Pg152" id="Pg152" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> charged with resolving righteousness into
            <span class="tei tei-q">“a sum of separate <span lang="he" class=
            "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="he"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">tzedāqôth</span></span>,”</span> or virtues.
            But this view strains his language unduly, and seems moreover to
            be negatived by the presuppositions of his argument. As a man
            must either live or die at the day of judgment, so he must at any
            moment be either righteous or wicked. The problematic case of a
            man who should conscientiously observe some of these requirements
            and deliberately violate others would have been dismissed by
            Ezekiel as an idle speculation: <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend
            in one point, he is guilty of all”</span> (James ii. 10). The
            very fact that former good deeds are not remembered to a man in
            the day when he turns from his righteousness shows that the state
            of righteousness is something different from an average struck
            from the statistics of his moral career. The bent of the
            character towards or away from goodness is no doubt spoken of as
            subject to sudden fluctuations, but for the time being each man
            is conceived as dominated by the one tendency or the other; and
            it is the bent of the whole nature towards the good that
            constitutes the righteousness by which a man shall live. It is at
            all events a mistake to suppose that the prophet is concerned
            only about the external act and indifferent to the state of heart
            from which it proceeds. It is true that he does not attempt to
            penetrate beneath the surface of the outward life. He does not
            analyse motives. But this is because he assumes that if a man
            keeps God's law he does it from a sincere desire to please God
            and with a sense of the rightness of the law to which he subjects
            his life. When we recognise this the charge of externalism
            amounts to very little. We can never get behind the principle
            that <span class="tei tei-q">“he that doeth righteousness is
            righteous”</span> (1 John iii. 7), and that principle covers all
            that Ezekiel really teaches. Compared with the more spiritual
            teaching of the New Testament his moral ideal <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page153">[pg 153]</span><a name="Pg153" id=
            "Pg153" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> is no doubt defective in many
            directions, but his insistence on action as a test of character
            is hardly one of them. We must remember that the New Testament
            itself contains as many warnings against a false spirituality as
            it does against the opposite error of reliance on good works.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The second
            great truth of personal religion is the moral freedom of the
            individual to determine his own destiny in the day of judgment.
            This is illustrated in the latter part of the chapter by the two
            opposite cases of a wicked man turning from his wickedness (vv.
            21, 22) and a righteous man turning from his righteousness (ver.
            24). And the teaching of the passage is that the effect of such a
            change of mind, as regards a man's relation to God, is absolute.
            The good life subsequent to conversion is not weighed against the
            sins of past years; it is the index of a new state of heart in
            which the guilt of former transgressions is entirely blotted out:
            <span class="tei tei-q">“All his transgressions that he hath
            committed shall not be remembered in regard to him; in his
            righteousness that he hath done he shall live.”</span> But in
            like manner the act of apostasy effaces the remembrance of good
            deeds done in an earlier period of the man's life. The standing
            of each soul before God, its righteousness or its wickedness, is
            thus wholly determined by its final choice of good or evil, and
            is revealed by the conduct which follows that great moral
            decision. There can be no doubt that Ezekiel regards these two
            possibilities as equally real, falling away from righteousness
            being as much a fact of experience as repentance. In the light of
            the New Testament we should perhaps interpret both cases somewhat
            differently. In genuine conversion we must recognise the
            imparting of a new spiritual principle which is ineradicable,
            containing <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page154">[pg
            154]</span><a name="Pg154" id="Pg154" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            the pledge of perseverance in the state of grace to the end. In
            the case of final apostasy we are compelled to judge that the
            righteousness which is renounced was only apparent, that it was
            no true indication of the man's character or of his condition in
            the sight of God. But these are not the questions with which the
            prophet is directly dealing. The essential truth which he
            inculcates is the emancipation of the individual, through
            repentance, from his own past. In virtue of his immediate
            personal relation to God each man has the power to accept the
            offer of salvation, to break away from his sinful life and escape
            the doom which hangs over the impenitent. To this one point the
            whole argument of the chapter tends. It is a demonstration of the
            possibility and efficacy of individual repentance, culminating in
            the declaration which lies at the very foundation of evangelical
            religion, that God has no pleasure in the death of him that
            dieth, but will have all men to repent and live (ver. 32).</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is not easy
            for us to conceive the effect of this revelation on the minds of
            people so utterly unprepared for it as the generation in which
            Ezekiel lived. Accustomed as they were to think of their
            individual fate as bound up in that of their nation, they could
            not at once adjust themselves to a doctrine which had never
            previously been enunciated with such incisive clearness. And it
            is not surprising that one effect of Ezekiel's teaching was to
            create fresh doubts of the rectitude of the divine government.
            <span class="tei tei-q">“The way of the Lord is not
            equal,”</span> it was said (vv. 25, 29). So long as it was
            admitted that men suffered for the sins of their ancestors or
            that God dealt with them in the mass, there was at least an
            appearance of consistency in the methods of Providence. The
            justice of God might not be visible in the life of the
            individual, but it could be roughly traced in the history of the
            nation as a whole. But when that principle was discarded, then
            the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page155">[pg 155]</span><a name=
            "Pg155" id="Pg155" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> question of the
            divine righteousness was raised in the case of each separate
            Israelite, and there immediately appeared all those perplexities
            about the lot of the individual which so sorely exercised the
            faith of Old Testament believers. Experience did not show that
            correspondence between a man's attitude towards God and his
            earthly fortunes which the doctrine of individual freedom seemed
            to imply; and even in Ezekiel's time it must have been evident
            that the calamities which overtook the state fell
            indiscriminately on the righteous and the wicked. The prophet's
            purpose, however, is a practical one, and he does not attempt to
            offer a theoretical solution of the difficulties which thus
            arose. There were several considerations in his mind which turned
            aside the edge of the people's complaint against the
            righteousness of Jehovah. One was the imminence of the final
            judgment, in which the absolute rectitude of the divine procedure
            would be clearly manifested. Another seems to be the irresolute
            and unstable attitude of the people themselves towards the great
            moral issues which were set before them. While they professed to
            be more righteous than their fathers, they showed no settled
            purpose of amendment in their lives. A man might be apparently
            righteous to-day and a sinner to-morrow; the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“inequality”</span> of which they complained was in
            their own ways, and not in the way of the Lord (vv. 25, 29). But
            the most important element in the case was the prophet's
            conception of the character of God as one who, though strictly
            just, yet desired that men should live. The Lord is
            longsuffering, not willing that any should perish; and He
            postpones the day of decision that His goodness may lead men to
            repentance. <span class="tei tei-q">“Have I any pleasure in the
            death of the wicked? saith the Lord: and not that he should turn
            from his ways, and live?”</span> (ver. 23). And all these
            considerations lead up to the urgent call to repentance with
            which the chapter closes.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page156">[pg 156]</span><a name="Pg156" id="Pg156" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The importance
            of the questions dealt with in this eighteenth chapter is shown
            clearly enough by the hold which they have over the minds of men
            in the present day. The very same difficulties which Ezekiel had
            to encounter in his time confront us still in a somewhat altered
            form, and are often keenly felt as obstacles to faith in God. The
            scientific doctrine of heredity, for example, seems to be but a
            more precise modern rendering of the old proverb about the eating
            of sour grapes. The biological controversy over the possibility
            of the transmission of acquired characteristics scarcely touches
            the moral problem. In whatever way that controversy may be
            ultimately settled, it is certain that in all cases a man's life
            is affected both for good and evil by influences which descend
            upon him from his ancestry. Similarly within the sphere of the
            individual life the law of habit seems to exclude the possibility
            of complete emancipation from the penalty due to past
            transgressions. Hardly anything, in short, is better established
            by experience than that the consequences of past actions persist
            through all changes of spiritual condition, and, further, that
            children do suffer from the consequences of their parents'
            sin.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Do not these
            facts, it may be asked, amount practically to a vindication of
            the theory of retribution against which the prophet's argument is
            directed? How can we reconcile them with the great principles
            enunciated in this chapter? Dictates of morality, fundamental
            truths of religion, these may be; but can we say in the face of
            experience that they are true?</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It must be
            admitted that a complete answer to these questions is not given
            in the chapter before us, nor perhaps anywhere in the Old
            Testament. So long as God dealt with men mainly by temporal
            rewards and punishments, it was impossible to realise fully the
            separateness of the soul in its spiritual relations to God; the
            fate of the individual <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page157">[pg
            157]</span><a name="Pg157" id="Pg157" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            is necessarily merged in that of the community, and Ezekiel's
            doctrine remains a prophecy of better things to be revealed. This
            indeed is the light in which he himself teaches us to regard it;
            although he applies it in all its strictness to the men of his
            own generation, it is nevertheless essentially a feature of the
            ideal kingdom of God, and is to be exhibited in the judgment by
            which that kingdom is introduced. The great value of his teaching
            therefore lies in his having formulated with unrivalled clearness
            principles which are eternally true of the spiritual life,
            although the perfect manifestation of these principles in the
            experience of believers was reserved for the final revelation of
            salvation in Christ.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The solution
            of the contradiction referred to lies in the separation between
            the natural and the penal consequences of sin. There is a sphere
            within which natural laws have their course, modified, it may be,
            but not wholly suspended by the law of the spirit of life in
            Christ. The physical effects of vicious indulgence are not turned
            aside by repentance, and a man may carry the scars of sin upon
            him to the grave. But there is also a sphere into which natural
            law does not enter. In his immediate personal relation to God a
            believer is raised above the evil consequences which flow from
            his past life, so that they have no power to separate him from
            the love of God. And within that sphere his moral freedom and
            independence are as much matter of experience as is his
            subjection to law in another sphere. He knows that all things
            work together for his good, and that tribulation itself is a
            means of bringing him nearer to God. Amongst those tribulations
            which work out his salvation there may be the evil conditions
            imposed on him by the sin of others, or even the natural
            consequences of his own former transgressions. But tribulations
            no longer bear the aspect of penalty, and are no longer a token
            of the wrath of God. They are <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page158">[pg 158]</span><a name="Pg158" id="Pg158" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> transformed into chastisements by which the
            Father of spirits makes His children perfect in holiness. The
            hardest cross to bear will always be that which is the result of
            one's own sin; but He who has borne the guilt of it can
            strengthen us to bear even this and follow Him.<a id="noteref_46"

          Chapter xxi.</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The date at the
          beginning of ch. xx. introduces the fourth and last section of the
          prophecies delivered before the destruction of Jerusalem. It also
          divides the first period of Ezekiel's ministry into two equal
          parts. The time is the month of August, 590 <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, two years after his
          prophetic inauguration and two years before the investment of
          Jerusalem. It follows that if the book of Ezekiel presents anything
          like a faithful picture of his actual work, by far his most
          productive year was that which had just closed. It embraces the
          long and varied series of discourses from ch. viii. to ch. xix.;
          whereas five chapters are all that remain as a record of his
          activity during the next two years. This result is not so
          improbable as at first sight it might appear. From the character of
          Ezekiel's prophecy, which consists largely of homiletic
          amplifications of one great theme, it is quite intelligible that
          the main lines of his teaching should have taken shape in his mind
          at an early period of his ministry. The discourses in the earlier
          part of the book may have been expanded in the act of committing
          them to writing; but there is no reason to doubt that the ideas
          they contain were present to the prophet's mind and were actually
          delivered by him within the period to which they are assigned. We
          may therefore suppose that Ezekiel's public exhortations became
          less frequent during the two <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page160">[pg 160]</span><a name="Pg160" id="Pg160" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> years that preceded the siege, just as we
          know that for two years after that event they were altogether
          discontinued.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this last
          division of the prophecies relating to the destruction of Jerusalem
          we can easily distinguish two different classes of oracles. On the
          one hand we have two chapters dealing with contemporary
          incidents—the march of Nebuchadnezzar's army against Jerusalem (ch.
          xxi.), and the commencement of the siege of the city (ch. xxiv.).
          In spite of the confident opinion of some critics that these
          prophecies could not have been composed till after the fall of
          Jerusalem, they seem to me to bear the marks of having been written
          under the immediate influence of the events they describe. It is
          difficult otherwise to account for the excitement under which the
          prophet labours, especially in ch. xxi., which stands by the side
          of ch. vii. as the most agitated utterance in the whole book. On
          the other hand we have three discourses of the nature of formal
          indictments—one directed against the exiles (ch. xx.), one against
          Jerusalem (ch. xxii.), and one against the whole nation of Israel
          (ch. xxiii.). It is impossible in these chapters to discover any
          advance in thought upon similar passages that have already been
          before us. Two of them (chs. xx. and xxiii.) are historical
          retrospects after the manner of ch. xvi., and there is no obvious
          reason why they should be placed in a different section of the
          book. The key to the unity of the section must therefore be sought
          in the two historical prophecies and in the situation created by
          the events they describe.<a id="noteref_47" name="noteref_47" href=
          "#note_47"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">47</span></span></a> It
          will therefore help to clear the ground if we commence with the
          oracle <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page161">[pg
          161]</span><a name="Pg161" id="Pg161" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          which throws most light on the historical background of this group
          of prophecies—the oracle of Jehovah's sword against Jerusalem in
          ch. xxi.<a id="noteref_48" name="noteref_48" href=
          "#note_48"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
          long-projected rebellion has at length broken out. Zedekiah has
          renounced his allegiance to the king of Babylon, and the army of
          the Chaldæans is on its way to suppress the insurrection. The
          precise date of these events is not known. For some reason the
          conspiracy of the Palestinian states had hung fire; many years had
          been allowed to slip away since the time when their envoys had met
          in Jerusalem to concert measures of united resistance (Jer.
          xxvii.). This procrastination was, as usual, a sure presage of
          disaster. In the interval the league had dissolved. Some of its
          members had made terms with Nebuchadnezzar; and it would appear
          that only Tyre, Judah, and Ammon ventured on open defiance of his
          power. The hope was cherished in Jerusalem, and probably also among
          the Jews in Babylon, that the first assault of the Chaldæans would
          be directed against the Ammonites, and that time would thus be
          gained to complete the defences of Jerusalem. To dispel this
          illusion is one obvious purpose of the prophecy before us. The
          movements of Nebuchadnezzar's army are directed by a wisdom higher
          than his own; he is the unconscious instrument by which Jehovah is
          executing His own purpose. The real object of his expedition is not
          to punish a few <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page162">[pg
          162]</span><a name="Pg162" id="Pg162" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          refractory tribes for an act of disloyalty, but to vindicate the
          righteousness of Jehovah in the destruction of the city which had
          profaned His holiness. No human calculations will be allowed even
          for a moment to turn aside the blow which is aimed directly at
          Jerusalem's sins, or to obscure the lesson taught by its sure and
          unerring aim.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We can imagine
          the restless suspense and anxiety with which the final struggle for
          the national cause was watched by the exiles in Babylon. In
          imagination they would follow the long march of the Chaldæan hosts
          by the Euphrates and their descent by the valleys of the Orontes
          and Leontes upon the city. Eagerly would they wait for some tidings
          of a reverse which would revive their drooping hope of a speedy
          collapse of the great world-empire and a restoration of Israel to
          its ancient freedom. And when at length they heard that Jerusalem
          was enclosed in the iron grip of these victorious legions, from
          which no human deliverance was possible, their mood would harden
          into one in which fanatical hope and sullen despair contended for
          the mastery. Into an atmosphere charged with such excitement
          Ezekiel hurls the series of predictions comprised in chs. xxi. and
          xxiv. With far other feelings than his fellows, but with as keen an
          interest as theirs, he follows the development of what he knows to
          be the last act in the long controversy between Jehovah and Israel.
          It is his duty to repeat once more the irrevocable decree—the
          divine <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">delenda est</span></span> against the guilty
          Jerusalem. But he does so in this instance in language whose
          vehemence betrays the agitation of his mind, and perhaps also the
          restlessness of the society in which he lived. The twenty-first
          chapter is a series of rhapsodies, the product of a state bordering
          on ecstasy, where different aspects of the impending judgment are
          set forth by the help of vivid images which pass in quick
          succession through the prophet's mind.</p><span class="tei tei-pb"

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first
            vision which the prophet sees of the approaching catastrophe (vv.
            1-4) is that of a forest conflagration, an occurrence which must
            have been as frequent in Palestine as a prairie fire in America.
            He sees a fire break out in the <span class="tei tei-q">“forest
            of the south,”</span> and rage with such fierceness that
            <span class="tei tei-q">“every green tree and every dry
            tree”</span> is burned up; the faces of all who are near it are
            scorched, and all men are convinced that so terrible a calamity
            must be the work of Jehovah Himself. This we may suppose to have
            been the form in which the truth first laid hold of Ezekiel's
            imagination; but he appears to have hesitated to proclaim his
            message in this form. His figurative manner of speech had become
            notorious among the exiles (ver. 5), and he was conscious that a
            <span class="tei tei-q">“parable”</span> so vague and general as
            this would be dismissed as an ingenious riddle which might mean
            anything or nothing. What follows (vv. 7-10) gives the key to the
            original vision. Although it is in form an independent oracle, it
            is closely parallel to the preceding and elucidates each feature
            in detail. The <span class="tei tei-q">“forest of the
            south”</span> is explained to mean the land of Israel; and the
            mention of the sword of Jehovah instead of the fire intimates
            less obscurely that the instrument of the threatened calamity is
            the Babylonian army. It is interesting to observe that Ezekiel
            expressly admits that there were righteous men even in the doomed
            Israel. Contrary to his conception of the normal methods of the
            divine righteousness, he conceives of <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em>
            judgment as one which involves righteous and wicked in a common
            ruin. Not that God is less than righteous in this crowning act of
            vengeance, but His justice is not brought to bear on the fate of
            individuals. He is dealing with the nation as a whole, and in the
            exterminating judgment of the nation good men <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page164">[pg 164]</span><a name="Pg164" id=
            "Pg164" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> will no more be spared than
            the green tree of the forest escapes the fate of the dry. It was
            the fact that righteous men perished in the fall of Jerusalem;
            and Ezekiel does not shut his eyes to it, firmly as he believed
            that the time was come when God would reward every man according
            to his own character. The indiscriminateness of the judgment in
            its bearing on different classes of persons is obviously a
            feature which Ezekiel here seeks to emphasise.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the idea
            of the sword of Jehovah drawn from its scabbard, to return no
            more till it has accomplished its mission, is the one that has
            fixed itself most deeply in the prophet's imagination, and forms
            the connecting link between this vision and the other
            amplifications of the same theme which follow.</p>

            the symbolic action of vv. 11-13, representing the horror and
            astonishment with which the dire tidings of Jerusalem's fall will
            be received, we come to the point where the prophet breaks into
            the wild strain of dithyrambic poetry, which has been called the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Song of the Sword”</span> (vv. 14-22).

            its obscurity, its abrupt transitions, and its strange blending
            of the divine with the human personality, the ode exhibits a
            definite poetic form and a real progress of thought from the
            beginning to the close. Throughout the passage we observe that
            the prophet's gaze is fascinated by the glittering sword which
            symbolised the instrument of Jehovah's vengeance. In the opening
            stanza (i) he describes the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">preparation</span></em> of the sword; he
            notes the keenness of its edge and its glittering sheen with an
            awful presentiment that an implement so elaborately fashioned is
            destined for some terrible day of slaughter. Then (ii) he
            announces the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">purpose</span></em> for which the sword is
            prepared, and breaks into loud lamentation as he realises that
            its doomed victims are his own people and the princes of Israel.
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page166">[pg 166]</span><a name=
            "Pg166" id="Pg166" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> In the next stanza
            (iii) he sees the sword <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">in action</span></em>; wielded by an
            invisible hand, it flashes hither and thither, circling round its
            hapless victims as if two or three swords were at work instead of
            one. All hearts are paralysed with fear, but the sword does not
            cease its ravages until it has filled the ground with slain. Then
            at length the sword is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">at rest</span></em> (iv), having
            accomplished its work. The divine Speaker calls on it in a
            closing apostrophe <span class="tei tei-q">“to gather itself
            together”</span> as if for a final sweep to right and left,
            indicating the thoroughness with which the judgment has been
            executed. In the last verse the vision of the sword fades away,
            and the poem closes with an announcement, in the usual prophetic
            manner, of Jehovah's fixed purpose to <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“assuage”</span> His wrath against Israel by the
            crowning act of retribution.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If any doubt
            still remained as to what the sword of Jehovah meant, it is
            removed in the next section (vv. 23-32), where the prophet
            indicates the way by which the sword is to come on the kingdom of
            Judah. The Chaldæan monarch is represented as pausing on his
            march, perhaps at Riblah or some place to the north of Palestine,
            and deliberating whether he shall advance first against Judah or
            the Ammonites. He stands at the parting of the ways—on the left
            hand is the road to Rabbath-ammon, on the right that to
            Jerusalem. In his perplexity he invokes supernatural guidance,
            resorting to various expedients then in use for ascertaining the
            will of the gods and the path of good fortune. He <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“rattles the arrows”</span> (two of them in some kind
            of vessel, one for Jerusalem and the other for Riblah); he
            consults the teraphim and inspects the entrails of a sacrificial
            victim. This consulting of the omens was no doubt an invariable
            preliminary to every <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page167">[pg
            167]</span><a name="Pg167" id="Pg167" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            campaign, and was resorted to whenever an important military
            decision had to be made. It might seem a matter of indifference
            to a powerful monarch like Nebuchadnezzar which of two petty
            opponents he determined to crush first. But the kings of Babylon
            were religious men in their way, and never doubted that success
            depended on their following the indications that were given by
            the higher powers. In this case Nebuchadnezzar gets a true
            answer, but not from the deities whose aid he had invoked. In his
            right hand he finds the arrow marked <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Jerusalem.”</span> The die is cast, his resolution
            is taken, but it is Jehovah's sentence sealing the fate of
            Jerusalem that has been uttered.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such is the
            situation which Ezekiel in Babylon is directed to represent
            through a piece of obvious symbolism. A road diverging into two
            is drawn on the ground, and at the meeting-point a sign-post is
            erected indicating that the one leads to Ammon and the other to
            Judah. It is of course not necessary to suppose that the incident
            so graphically described actually occurred. The divination scene
            may only be imaginary, although it is certainly a true reflection
            of Babylonian ideas and customs. The truth conveyed is that the
            Babylonian army is moving under the immediate guidance of
            Jehovah, and that not only the political projects of the king,
            but his secret thoughts and even his superstitious reliance on
            signs and omens, are all overruled for the furtherance of the one
            purpose for which Jehovah has raised him up.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Meanwhile
            Ezekiel is well aware that in Jerusalem a very different
            interpretation is put on the course of events. When the news of
            the great king's decision reaches the men at the head of affairs
            they are not dismayed. They view the decision as the result of
            <span class="tei tei-q">“false divination”</span>; they laugh to
            scorn the superstitious rites which have determined the course of
            the campaign,—not that they suppose the king will not act on his
            omens, but they do not <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page168">[pg
            168]</span><a name="Pg168" id="Pg168" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            believe they are an augury of success. They had hoped for a short
            breathing space while Nebuchadnezzar was engaged on the east of
            the Jordan, but they will not shrink from the conflict whether it
            be to-day or to-morrow. Addressing himself to this state of mind,
            Ezekiel once more<a id="noteref_50" name="noteref_50" href=
            "#note_50"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">50</span></span></a>
            reminds those who hear him that these men are fighting against
            the moral laws of the universe. The existing kingdom of Judah
            occupies a false position before God and in the eyes of just men.
            It has no religious foundation; for the hope of the Messiah does
            not lie with that wearer of a dishonoured crown, the king
            Zedekiah, but with the legitimate heir of David now in exile. The
            state has no right to be except as part of the Chaldæan empire,
            and this right it has forfeited by renouncing its allegiance to
            its earthly superior. These men forget that in this quarrel the
            just cause is that of Nebuchadnezzar, whose enterprise only seems
            to <span class="tei tei-q">“call to mind their iniquity”</span>
            (ver. 28)—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            In provoking this conflict, therefore, they have put themselves
            in the wrong; they shall be caught in the toils of their own
            villainy.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The heaviest
            censure is reserved for Zedekiah, the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“wicked one, the prince of Israel, whose day is
            coming in the time of final retribution.”</span> This part of the
            prophecy has a close resemblance to the latter part of ch. xvii.
            The prophet's sympathies are still with the exiled king, or at
            least with that branch of the royal family which he represents.
            And the sentence of rejection on Zedekiah is again accompanied by
            a promise of the restoration of the kingdom in the person of the
            Messiah. The crown which has been dishonoured by the last king of
            Judah shall be taken from his head; that which is low shall be

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The last
            oracle is directed against the children of Ammon. By
            Nebuchadnezzar's decision to subdue Jerusalem first the Ammonites
            had gained a short respite. They even exulted in the humiliation
            of their former ally, and had apparently drawn the sword in order
            to seize part of the land of Judah. Misled by false diviners,
            they had dared to seek their own advantage in the calamities
            which Jehovah had brought on His own people. The prophet
            threatens the complete annihilation of Ammon, even in its own
            land, and the blotting out of its remembrance among the nations.
            That is the substance of the prophecy; but its form presents
            several points of difficulty. It begins with what appears to be
            an echo of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Song of the Sword”</span>
            in the earlier part of the chapter:—</p>

            <div class="tei tei-lg" style=
            "margin-bottom: 1.00em; margin-top: 1.00em">
              <div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left">
                A sword! a sword!
              </div>

              <div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left">
                It is drawn for slaughter; it is furbished to shine like
                lightning (ver. 33).
              </div>
            </div>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But as we
            proceed we find that it is the sword of the Ammonites that is
            meant, and they are ordered to return it to its sheath. If this
            be so, the tone of the passage must be ironical. It is in mockery
            that the prophet uses such magnificent language of the puny
            pretensions of Ammon to take a share in the work for which
            Jehovah has fashioned the mighty weapon of the Chaldæan army.
            There are other reminiscences of the earlier part of the chapter,
            such as the <span class="tei tei-q">“lying divination”</span> of
            ver. 34, and the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page170">[pg
            170]</span><a name="Pg170" id="Pg170" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            <span class="tei tei-q">“time of final retribution”</span> in the
            same verse. The allusion to the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“reproach”</span> of Ammon and its aggressive
            attitude seems to point to the time after the destruction of
            Jerusalem and the withdrawal of the army of Nebuchadnezzar.
            Whether the Ammonites had previously made their submission or not
            we cannot tell; but the fortieth and forty-first chapters of
            Jeremiah show that Ammon was still a hotbed of conspiracy against
            the Babylonian interest in the days after the fall of Jerusalem.
            These appearances make it probable that this part of the chapter
            is an appendix, added at a later time, and dealing with a
            situation which was developed after the destruction of the city.
            Its insertion in its present place is easily accounted for by the
            circumstance that the fate of Ammon had been linked with that of
            Jerusalem in the previous part of the chapter. The vindictive
            little nationality had used its respite to gratify its hereditary
            hatred of Israel, and now the judgment, suspended for a time,
            shall return with redoubled fury and sweep it from the earth.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Looking back
            over this series of prophecies, there seems reason to believe
            that, with the exception of the last, they are really
            contemporaneous with the events they deal with. It is true that
            they do not illuminate the historical situation to the same
            degree as those in which Isaiah depicts the advance of another
            invader and the development of another crisis in the people's
            history. This is due partly to the bent of Ezekiel's genius, but
            partly also to the very peculiar circumstances in which he was
            placed. The events which form the theme of his prophecy were
            transacted on a distant stage; neither he nor his immediate
            hearers were actors in the drama. He addresses himself to an
            audience wrought to the highest pitch of excitement, but swayed
            by hopes and rumours and vague surmises as to the probable issue
            of events. It was inevitable in these circumstances that his
            prophecy, even <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page171">[pg
            171]</span><a name="Pg171" id="Pg171" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            in those passages which deal with contemporary facts, should
            present but a pale reflection of the actual situation. In the
            case before us the one historical event which stands out clearly
            is the departure of Nebuchadnezzar with his army to Jerusalem.
            But what we read is genuine prophecy; not the artifice of a man
            using prophetic speech as a literary form, but the utterance of
            one who discerns the finger of God in the present, and interprets
            His purpose beforehand to the men of his day.</p>

          With Israel. Chapter xx.</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By far the
          hardest trial of Ezekiel's faith must have been the conduct of his
          fellow-exiles. It was amongst them that he looked for the great
          spiritual change which must precede the establishment of the
          kingdom of God; and he had already addressed to them words of
          consolation based on the knowledge that the hope of the future was
          theirs (ch. xi. 18). Yet the time passed on without bringing any
          indications that the promise was about to be fulfilled. There were
          no symptoms of national repentance; there was nothing even to show
          that the lessons of the Exile as interpreted by the prophet were
          beginning to be laid to heart. For these men, among whom he lived,
          were still inveterately addicted to idolatry. Strange as it must
          seem to us, the very men who cherished a fanatical faith in
          Jehovah's power to save His people were assiduously practising the
          worship of other gods. It is too readily assumed by some writers
          that the idolatry of the exiles was of the ambiguous kind which had
          prevailed so long in the land of Israel, that it was the worship of
          Jehovah under the form of images—a breach of the second
          commandment, but not of the first. The people who carried Jeremiah
          down to Egypt were as eager as Ezekiel's companions to hear a word
          from Jehovah; yet they were devoted to the worship of the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Queen of Heaven,”</span> and dated all
          their misfortunes from the time <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page173">[pg 173]</span><a name="Pg173" id="Pg173" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> when their women had ceased to pay court to
          her. There is no reason to believe that the Jews in Babylon were
          less catholic in their superstitions than those of Judæa; and
          indeed the whole drift of Ezekiel's expostulations goes to show
          that he has the worship of false gods in view. The ancient belief
          that the worship of Jehovah was specially associated with the land
          of Canaan is not likely to have been without influence on the minds
          of those who felt the fascination of idolatry, and must have
          strengthened the tendency to seek the aid of foreign gods in a
          foreign land.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The twentieth
          chapter deals with this matter of idolatry; and the fact that this
          important discourse was called forth by a visit from the elders of
          Israel shows how heavily the subject weighed on the prophet's mind.
          Whatever the purpose of the deputation may have been (and of that
          we have no information), it was certainly not to consult Ezekiel
          about the propriety of worshipping false gods. It is only because
          this great question dominates all his thoughts concerning them and
          their destiny that he connects the warning against idolatry with a
          casual inquiry addressed to him by the elders. The circumstances
          are so similar to those of ch. xiv. that Ewald was led to
          conjecture that both oracles originated in one and the same
          incident, and were separated from each other in writing because of
          the difference of their subjects. Ch. xiv. on that view justifies
          the refusal of an answer from a consideration of the true function
          of prophecy, while ch. xx. expands the admonition of the sixth
          verse of ch. xiv. into an elaborate review of the religious history
          of Israel. But there is really no good reason for identifying the
          two incidents. In neither passage does the prophet think it worth
          while to record the object of the inquiry addressed to him, and
          therefore conjecture is useless.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page174">[pg 174]</span><a name="Pg174" id="Pg174" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the very
          fact that a definite date is given for this visit leads us to
          consider whether it had not some peculiar significance to lodge it
          so firmly in Ezekiel's mind. Now the most suggestive hint which the
          chapter affords is the idea put into the lips of the exiles in ver.
          32: <span class="tei tei-q">“And as for the thought which arises in
          your mind, it shall not be, in that ye are thinking, We will become
          like the heathen, like the families of the lands, in worshipping
          wood and stone.”</span> These words contain the key to the whole
          discourse. It is difficult, no doubt, to decide how much exactly is
          implied in them. They may mean no more than the determination to
          keep up the external conformity to heathen customs which already
          existed in matters of worship—as, for example, in the use of
          images. But the form of expression used, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“that which is coming up in your mind,”</span> almost
          suggests that the prophet was face to face with an incipient
          tendency among the exiles, a deliberate resolve to apostatise and
          assimilate themselves for all religious purposes to the surrounding
          heathen. It is by no means improbable that, amidst the many
          conflicting tendencies that distracted the exiled community, this
          idea of a complete abandonment of the national religion should have
          crystallised into a settled purpose in the event of their last hope
          being disappointed. If this was the situation with which Ezekiel
          had to deal, we should be able to understand how his denunciation
          takes the precise form which it assumes in this chapter.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For what is, in
          the main, the purport of the chapter? Briefly stated the argument
          is as follows. The religion of Jehovah had never been the true
          expression of the national genius of Israel. Not now for the first
          time has the purpose of Israel come into conflict with the
          immutable purpose of Jehovah; but from the very beginning the
          history had been one long struggle between the natural inclinations
          of the people and the destiny which was <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page175">[pg 175]</span><a name="Pg175" id="Pg175" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> forced on it by the will of God. The love of
          idols had been the distinguishing feature of the national character
          from the beginning; and if it had been suffered to prevail, Israel
          would never have been known as Jehovah's people. Why had it not
          been suffered to prevail? Because of Jehovah's regard for the
          honour of His name; because in the eyes of the heathen His glory
          was identified with the fortunes of this particular people, to whom
          He had once revealed Himself. And as it has been in the past, so it
          will be in the future. The time has come for the age-long
          controversy to be brought to an issue, and it cannot be doubtful
          what the issue will be. <span class="tei tei-q">“That which comes
          up in their mind”</span>—this new resolve to live like the
          heathen—cannot turn aside the purpose of Jehovah to make of Israel
          a people for His own glory. Whatever further judgments may be
          necessary for that end, the land of Israel shall yet be the seat of
          a pure and acceptable worship of the true God, and the people shall
          recognise with shame and contrition that the goal of all its
          history has been accomplished in spite of its perversity by the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“irresistible grace”</span> of its divine
          King.</p>

            of national election which the prophet here unfolds. It takes the
            form of a parallel between two desert scenes, one at the
            beginning and the other at the close of Israel's history. The
            first part of the chapter deals with the religious significance
            of the transactions in the wilderness of Sinai and the events in
            Egypt which were introductory to them. It starts from Jehovah's
            free choice of the people while they were still living as
            idolaters in Egypt. Jehovah there revealed Himself to them as
            their God, and entered into a covenant<a id="noteref_52" name=
            "noteref_52" href="#note_52"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

            them; and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page176">[pg
            176]</span><a name="Pg176" id="Pg176" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            the covenant included on the one hand the promise of the land of
            Canaan, and on the other hand a requirement that the people
            should separate themselves from all forms of idolatry whether
            native or Egyptian. <span class="tei tei-q">“In the day that I
            chose Israel, ... and made Myself known to them in the land of
            Egypt, ... saying, I am Jehovah your God; in that day I lifted up
            My hand to them, to bring them out of the land of Egypt, into a
            land which I had sought out for them. And I said to them, Cast
            away each man the abomination of his eyes, and defile not
            yourselves with the block-gods of Egypt. I am Jehovah your
            God”</span> (vv. 5-7). The point which Ezekiel specially
            emphasises is that this vocation to be the people of the true God
            was thrust on Israel without its consent, and that the revelation
            of Jehovah's purpose evoked no response in the heart of the
            people. By persistence in idolatry they had virtually renounced
            the kingship of Jehovah and forfeited their right to the
            fulfilment of the promise He had given them. And only from regard
            to His name, that it might not be profaned in the sight of the
            nations, before whose eyes He had made Himself known to them, did
            He turn from the purpose He had formed to destroy them in the
            land of Egypt.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In several
            respects this account of the occurrences in Egypt goes beyond
            what we learn from any other source. The historical books contain
            no reference to the prevalence of specifically Egyptian forms of
            idolatry among the Hebrews, nor do they mention any threat to
            exterminate the people for their rebellion. It is not to be
            supposed, however, that Ezekiel possessed other records of the
            period before the Exodus than those preserved in the Pentateuch.
            The fundamental conceptions are those attested by the history,
            that God first revealed Himself to Israel by the name Jehovah
            through Moses, and that the revelation was accompanied by a
            promise of deliverance <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page177">[pg
            177]</span><a name="Pg177" id="Pg177" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            from Egypt. That the people in spite of this revelation continued
            to worship idols is an inference from the whole of their
            subsequent history. And the conflict in the mind of Jehovah
            between anger against the people's sin and jealousy for His own
            name is not a matter of history at all, but is an inspired
            interpretation of the history in the light of the divine
            holiness, which embraces both these elements.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the
            wilderness Israel entered on the second and decisive stage of its
            probation which falls into two acts, and whose determining factor
            was the legislation. To the generation of the Exodus Jehovah made
            known the way of life in a code of law which on its own intrinsic
            merits ought to have commended itself to their moral sense. The
            statutes and judgments that were then given were such that
            <span class="tei tei-q">“if a man do them he shall live by
            them”</span> (ver. 11). This thought of the essential goodness of
            the law as originally given reveals Ezekiel's view of God's
            relation to men. It derives its significance no doubt from the
            contrast with legislation of an opposite character afterwards
            mentioned. Yet even that contrast expresses a conviction in the
            prophet's mind that morality is not constituted by arbitrary
            enactments on the part of God, but that there are eternal
            conditions of ethical fellowship between God and man, and that
            the law first offered for Israel's acceptance was the embodiment
            of those ethical relations which flow from the nature of Jehovah.
            It is probable that Ezekiel has in view the moral precepts of the
            Decalogue. If so, it is instructive to notice that the Sabbath
            law is separately mentioned, not as one of the laws by which a
            man lives, but as a sign of the covenant between Jehovah and
            Israel. The divine purpose was again defeated by the idolatrous
            proclivities of the people: <span class="tei tei-q">“They
            despised My judgments, and they did not walk in My statutes, and
            they profaned My Sabbaths, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">because</span></em> their heart went after
            their idols”</span> (ver. 16).</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To the second
            generation in the wilderness the offer of the covenant was
            renewed, with the same result (vv. 18-24). It should be observed
            that in both cases the disobedience of the people is answered by
            two distinct utterances of Jehovah's wrath. The first is a threat
            of immediate extermination, which is expressed as a momentary
            purpose of Jehovah, no sooner formed than withdrawn for the sake
            of His honour (vv. 14, 21). The other is a judgment of a more
            limited character, uttered in the form of an oath, and in the
            first case at least actually carried out. For the threat of
            exclusion from the Promised Land (ver. 15) was enforced so far as
            the first generation was concerned. Now the parallelism between
            the two sections leads us to expect that the similar threat of
            dispersion in ver. 23 is meant to be understood of a judgment
            actually inflicted. We may conclude, therefore, that ver. 23
            refers to the Babylonian exile and the dispersion among the
            nations, which hung like a doom over the nation during its whole
            history in Canaan, and is represented as a direct consequence of
            their transgressions in the wilderness. There seems reason to
            believe that the particular allusion is to the twenty-eighth
            chapter of Deuteronomy, where the threat of a dispersion among
            the nations concludes the long list of curses which will follow
            disobedience to the law (Deut. xxviii. 64-68). It is true that in
            that chapter the threat is only conditional; but in the time of
            Ezekiel it had already been fulfilled, and it is in accordance
            with his whole conception of the history to read the final issue
            back into the early period when the national character was
            determined.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But in
            addition to this, as if effectually to <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“conclude them under sin,”</span> Jehovah met the
            hardness of their hearts by imposing on them laws of an opposite
            character to those first given, and laws which accorded only too
            well with their baser inclinations: <span class="tei tei-q">“And
            I also gave <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page179">[pg

            should not live; and I rendered them unclean in their offerings,
            by making over all that opened the womb, that I might horrify
            them”</span> (vv. 25, 26).</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This division
            of the wilderness legislation into two kinds, one good and
            life-giving and the other not good, presents difficulties both
            moral and critical which cannot perhaps be altogether removed.
            The general direction in which the solution must be sought is
            indeed tolerably clear. The reference is to the law which
            required the consecration of the firstborn of all animals to
            Jehovah. This was interpreted in the most rigorous sense as
            dedication in sacrifice; and then the principle was extended to
            the case of human beings. The divine purpose in appearing to
            sanction this atrocious practice was to <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“horrify”</span> the people—that is to say, the
            punishment of their idolatry consisted in the shock to their
            natural instincts and affections caused by the worst development
            of the idolatrous spirit to which they were delivered. We are not
            to infer from this that human sacrifice was an element of the
            original Hebrew religion, and that it was actually based on
            legislative enactment. The truth appears to be that the sacrifice
            of children was originally a feature of Canaanitish worship,
            particularly of the god Melek or Molech, and was only introduced
            into the religion of Israel in the evil days which preceded the
            fall of the state.<a id="noteref_53" name="noteref_53" href=
            "#note_53"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">53</span></span></a> The
            idea took hold of men's minds that this terrible rite alone
            revealed the full potency of the sacrificial act; and when the
            ordinary means of propitiation seemed to fail, it was resorted to
            as the last desperate expedient for appeasing an offended deity.
            All that Ezekiel's words warrant us in assuming is that when once
            the practice <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page180">[pg
            180]</span><a name="Pg180" id="Pg180" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            was established it was defended by an appeal to the ancient law
            of the firstborn, the principle of which was held to cover the
            case of human sacrifices. These laws, relating to the
            consecration of firstborn animals, are therefore the statutes
            referred to by Ezekiel; and their defect lies in their being open
            to such an immoral misinterpretation. This view is in accordance
            with the probabilities of the case. When we consider the tendency
            of the Old Testament writers to refer all actual events
            immediately to the will of God, we can partly understand the form
            in which Ezekiel expresses the facts; and this is perhaps all
            that can be said on the moral aspect of the difficulty. It is but
            an application of the principle that sin is punished by moral
            obliquity, and precepts which are accommodated to the hardness of
            men's hearts are by that same hardness perverted to fatal issues.
            It cannot even be said that there is a radical divergence of view
            between Ezekiel and Jeremiah on this subject. For when the older
            prophet, speaking of child-sacrifice, says that Jehovah
            <span class="tei tei-q">“commanded it not, neither came it into
            His mind”</span> (ch. vii. 31 and ch. xix. 5), he must have in
            view men who justified the custom by an appeal to ancient
            legislation. And although Jeremiah indignantly repudiates the
            suggestion that such horrors were contemplated by the law of
            Jehovah, he hardly in this goes beyond Ezekiel, who declares that
            the ordinance in question does not represent the true mind of
            Jehovah, but belongs to a part of the law which was intended to
            punish sin by delusion.<a id="noteref_54" name="noteref_54" href=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In consequence
            of these transactions in the desert Israel entered the land of
            Canaan under the threat of eventual exile and under the curse of
            a polluted worship. The subsequent history has little
            significance from the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page182">[pg
            182]</span><a name="Pg182" id="Pg182" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            point of view occupied throughout this discourse; and accordingly
            Ezekiel disposes of it in three verses (27-29). The entrance on
            the Promised Land, he says, furnished the opportunity for a new
            manifestation of disloyalty to Jehovah. He refers to the
            multiplication of heathen or semi-heathen sanctuaries throughout
            the land. Wherever they saw a high hill or a leafy tree, they
            made it a place of sacrifice, and there they practised the impure
            rites which were the outcome of their false conception of the
            Deity. To the mind of Ezekiel the unity of Jehovah and the unity
            of the sanctuary were inseparable ideas: the offence here alluded
            to is therefore of the same kind as the abominations practised in
            Egypt and the desert; it is a violation of the holiness of
            Jehovah. The prophet condenses his scorn for the whole system of
            religion which led to a multiplication of sanctuaries into a play
            on the etymology of the word <span lang="he" class=

            Application</span></span> (vv. 30-44).—Having thus described the
            origin of idolatry in Israel, and having shown that the destiny
            of the nation had been determined neither by its deserts nor by
            its inclinations, but by Jehovah's consistent regard for the
            honour of His name, the prophet proceeds to bring the lesson of
            the history to bear on his contemporaries. The Captivity has as
            yet produced no change in their spiritual condition; in Babylon
            they still defile themselves with the same abominations as their
            ancestors, even to the crowning atrocity of child-sacrifice.
            Their idolatry is if anything more conscious than before, for it
            takes the shape of a deliberate intention to be as other
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page183">[pg 183]</span><a name=
            "Pg183" id="Pg183" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> nations,
            worshipping wood and stone. It is necessary therefore that once
            for all Jehovah should assert His sovereignty over Israel, and
            bend their stubborn will to the accomplishment of His purpose.
            <span class="tei tei-q">“As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah,
            surely with a strong hand, and with an outstretched arm, and
            wrath poured out, will I be king over you”</span> (ver. 33). But
            how was this to be done? A heavier chastisement than that which
            had been inflicted on the exiles could hardly be conceived, yet
            it had effected nothing for the regeneration of Israel. Surely
            the time is come when the divine method must be changed, when
            those who have hardened themselves against the severity of God
            must be won by His goodness? Such, however, is not the thought
            expressed in Ezekiel's delineation of the future. It is possible
            that the description which follows (vv. 34-38) may only be meant
            as an ideal picture of spiritual processes to be effected by
            ordinary providential agencies. But certain it is that what
            Ezekiel is chiefly convinced of is the necessity for further acts
            of judgment—judgment which shall be decisive, because
            discriminating, and issuing in the annihilation of all who cling
            to the evil traditions of the past. This idea, indeed, of further
            chastisement in store for the exiles is a fixed element of
            Ezekiel's prophecy. It appears in his earliest public utterance
            (ch. v.), although it is perhaps only in this chapter that we
            perceive its full significance.</p>

            plateau which stretches between the Jordan and the Euphrates

            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">during
            a second sojourn in the wilderness</span></em>, although a very
            striking one, occurs only here in the book of Ezekiel, and it can
            hardly be considered as one of the cardinal ideas of his
            eschatology. It is in all probability derived from the prophecies
            of Hosea, although it is modified in accordance with the very
            different estimate of the nation's history represented by
            Ezekiel. It is instructive to compare the teaching of these two
            prophets on this point. To Hosea the idea of a return to the
            desert presents itself naturally as an element of the process by
            which Israel is to be brought back to its allegiance to Jehovah.
            The return to the desert restores the conditions under which the
            nation had first known and followed Jehovah. He looks back to the
            sojourn in the wilderness of Sinai as the time of uninterrupted
            communion between Jehovah and Israel—a time of youthful
            innocence, when the sinful tendencies which may have been latent
            in the nation had not developed into actual infidelity. The
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page185">[pg 185]</span><a name=
            "Pg185" id="Pg185" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> decay of religion
            and morality dates from the possession of the land of Canaan, and
            is traced to the corrupting influence of Canaanitish idolatry and
            civilisation. It was at Baal-peor that they first succumbed to
            the attractions of a false religion and became contaminated with
            the spirit of heathenism. Then the rich produce of the land came
            to be regarded as the gift of the deities who were worshipped at
            the local sanctuaries, and this worship with its sensuous
            accompaniments was the means of estranging the people more and
            more from the knowledge of Jehovah. Hence the first step towards
            a renewal of the relation between God and Israel is the
            withdrawal of the gifts of nature, the suppression of religious
            ordinances and political institutions; and this is represented as
            effected by a return to the primitive life of the desert. Then in
            her desolation and affliction the heart of Israel shall respond
            once more to the love of Jehovah, who has never ceased to yearn
            after His unfaithful people. <span class="tei tei-q">“I will
            allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak to her
            heart: ... and she shall make answer there, as in the days of her
            youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of
            Egypt”</span> (Hos. ii. 14, 15). Here there may be a doubt
            whether the wilderness is to be taken literally or as a figure
            for exile, but in either case the image naturally arises out of
            Hosea's profoundly simple conception of religion.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To Ezekiel, on
            the other hand, the <span class="tei tei-q">“wilderness”</span>
            is a synonym for contention and judgment. It is the scene where
            the meanness and perversity of man stand out in unrelieved
            contrast with the majesty and purity of God. He recognises no
            glad springtime of promise and hope in the history of Israel, no
            <span class="tei tei-q">“kindness of her youth”</span> or
            <span class="tei tei-q">“love of her espousals”</span> when she
            went after Jehovah in the land that was not sown (Jer. ii. 2).
            The difference between Hosea's conception and Ezekiel's is that
            in the view of the exilic prophet there never has been any true
            response <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page186">[pg
            186]</span><a name="Pg186" id="Pg186" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            on the part of Israel to the call of God. Hence a return to the
            desert can only mean a repetition of the judgments that had
            marked the first sojourn of the people in the wilderness of
            Sinai, and the carrying of them to the point of a final decision
            between the claims of Jehovah and the stubbornness of His
            people.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If it be asked
            which of these representations of the past is the true one, the
            only answer possible is that from the standpoint from which the
            prophets viewed history both are true. Israel did follow Jehovah
            through the wilderness, and took possession of the land of Canaan
            animated by an ardent faith in His power. It is equally true that
            the religious condition of the people had its dark side, and that
            they were far from understanding the nature of the God whose name
            they bore. And a prophet might emphasise the one truth or the
            other according to the idea of God which it was given him to
            teach. Hosea, reading the religious symptoms of his own time,
            sees in it a contrast to the happier period when life was simple
            and religion comparatively pure, and finds in the desert sojourn
            an image of the purifying process by which the national life must
            be renewed. Ezekiel had to do with a more difficult problem. He
            saw that there was a power of evil which could not be eradicated
            merely by banishment from the land of Israel—a hard bed-rock of
            unbelief and superstition in the national character which had
            never yielded to the influence of revelation; and he dwells on
            all the manifestations of this which he read in the past. His
            hope for the future of the cause of God rests no longer on the
            moral influence of the divine love on the heart of man, but on
            the power of Jehovah to accomplish His purpose in spite of the
            resistance of human sin. That was not the whole truth about God's
            relation to Israel, but it was the truth that needed to be
            impressed on the generation of the Exile.</p><span class=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of the final
            issue at all events Ezekiel is not doubtful. He is a man who is
            <span class="tei tei-q">“very sure of God”</span> and sure of
            nothing else. In man he finds nothing to inspire him with
            confidence in the ultimate victory of the true religion over
            polytheism and superstition. His own generation has shown itself
            fit only to perpetuate the evils of the past—the love of sensuous
            worship, the insensibility to the claims and nature of Jehovah,
            which had marked the whole history of Israel. He is compelled for
            the present to abandon them to their corrupt inclinations,<a id=
            "noteref_58" name="noteref_58" href="#note_58"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">58</span></span></a>
            expecting no signs of amendment until his appeal is enforced by
            signal acts of judgment.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But all this
            does not shake his sublime faith in the fulfilment of Israel's
            destiny. Despairing of men, he falls back on what St. Paul calls
            the <span class="tei tei-q">“purpose of God according to
            election”</span> (Rom. ix. 11). And with an insight akin to that
            of the apostle of the Gentiles, he discerns through all Jehovah's
            dealings with Israel a principle and an ideal which must in the
            end prevail over the sin of men. The goal to which the history
            points stands out clear before the mind of the prophet; and
            already he sees in vision the restored Israel—a holy people in a
            renovated land—rendering acceptable worship to the one God of
            heaven and earth. <span class="tei tei-q">“For in My holy
            mountain, in the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page188">[pg
            188]</span><a name="Pg188" id="Pg188" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

            things”</span> (ver. 40).</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There we have
            the thought which is expanded in the vision of the purified
            theocracy which occupies the closing chapters of the book. And it
            is important to notice this indication that the idea of that
            vision was present to Ezekiel during the earlier part of his
            ministry.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The allegory of
          ch. xxiii. adds hardly any new thought to those which have already
          been expounded in connection with ch. xvi. and ch. xx. The ideas
          which enter into it are all such as we are now familiar with. They
          are: the idolatry of Israel, learned in Egypt and persisted in to
          the end of her history; her fondness for alliances with the great
          Oriental empires, which was the occasion of new developments of
          idolatry; the corruption of religion by the introduction of human
          sacrifice into the service of Jehovah; and, finally, the
          destruction of Israel by the hands of the nations whose friendship
          she had so eagerly courted. The figure under which these facts are
          presented is the same as in ch. xvi., and many of the details of
          the earlier prophecy are reproduced here with little variation. But
          along with these resemblances we find certain characteristic
          features in this chapter which require attention, and perhaps some
          explanation.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In its treatment
          of the history this passage is distinguished from the other two by
          the recognition of the separate existence of the northern and
          southern kingdoms. In the previous retrospects Israel has either
          been treated as a unity (as in ch. xx.), or attention has been
          wholly concentrated on the fortunes of Judah, Samaria being
          regarded as on a level with a purely heathen city like Sodom (ch.
          xvi.). Ezekiel may have felt that he has not <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page190">[pg 190]</span><a name="Pg190" id="Pg190"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> yet done justice to the truth that the
          history of Israel ran in two parallel lines, and that the full
          significance of God's dealings with the nation can only be
          understood when the fate of Samaria is placed alongside of that of
          Jerusalem. He did not forget that he was sent as a prophet to the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“whole house of Israel,”</span> and indeed
          all the great pre-exilic prophets realised that their message
          concerned <span class="tei tei-q">“the whole family which Jehovah
          had brought up out of Egypt”</span> (Amos iii. 1). Besides this the
          chapter affords in many ways an interesting illustration of the
          workings of the prophet's mind in the effort to realise vividly the
          nature of his people's sin and the meaning of its fate. In this
          respect it is perhaps the most finished and comprehensive product
          of his imagination, although it may not reveal the depth of
          religious insight exhibited in the sixteenth chapter.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The main idea of
          the allegory is no doubt borrowed from a prophecy of Jeremiah
          belonging to the earlier part of his ministry (Jer. iii. 6-13). The
          fall of Samaria was even then a somewhat distant memory, but the
          use which Jeremiah makes of it seems to show that the lesson of it
          had not altogether ceased to impress the mind of the southern
          kingdom. In the third chapter he reproaches Judah the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“treacherous”</span> for not having taken warning from
          the fate of her sister the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“apostate”</span> Israel, who has long since received
          the reward of her infidelities. The same lesson is implied in the
          representation of Ezekiel (ver. 11); but as is usual with our
          prophet, the simple image suggested by Jeremiah is drawn out in an
          elaborate allegory, into which as many details are crowded as it
          will bear. In place of the epithets by which Jeremiah characterises
          the moral condition of Israel and Judah, Ezekiel coins two new and
          somewhat obscure names—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Ohola</span></span> for Samaria, and
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Oholibah</span></span> for Jerusalem.<a id=
          "noteref_59" name="noteref_59" href="#note_59"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">59</span></span></a></p><span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page191">[pg 191]</span><a name="Pg191" id="Pg191" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These women are
          children of one mother, and afterwards become wives of one
          husband—Jehovah. This need occasion no surprise in an allegorical
          representation, although it is contrary to a law which Ezekiel
          doubtless knew (Lev. xviii. 18). Nor is it strange, considering the
          freedom with which he handles the facts of history, that the
          division between Israel and Judah is carried back to the time of
          the oppression in Egypt. We have indeed no certainty that this view
          is not historical. The cleavage between the north and the south did
          not originate with the revolt of Jeroboam. That great schism only
          brought out elements of antagonism which were latent in the
          relations of the tribe of Judah to the northern tribes. Of this
          there are many indications in the earlier history, and for what we
          know the separation might have existed among the Hebrews in Goshen.
          Still, it is not probable that Ezekiel was thinking of any such
          thing. He is bound by the limits of his allegory; and there was no
          other way <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page192">[pg
          192]</span><a name="Pg192" id="Pg192" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          by which he could combine the presentation of the two essential
          elements of his conception—that Samaria and Jerusalem were branches
          of the one people of Jehovah, and that the idolatry which marked
          their history had been learned in the youth of the nation in the
          land of Egypt.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That neither
          Israel nor Judah ever shook off the spell of their adulterous
          connection with Egypt, but returned to it again and again down to
          the close of their history, is certainly one point which the
          prophet means to impress on the minds of his readers (vv. 8, 19,
          27). With this exception the earlier part of the chapter (to ver.
          35) deals exclusively with the later developments of idolatry from
          the eighth century and onwards. And one of the most remarkable
          things in it is the description of the manner in which first Israel
          and then Judah was entangled in political relations with the
          Oriental empires. There seems to be a vein of sarcasm in the sketch
          of the gallant Assyrian officers who turned the heads of the giddy
          and frivolous sisters and seduced them from their allegiance to
          Jehovah: <span class="tei tei-q">“Ohola doted on her lovers, on the
          Assyrian warriors<a id="noteref_60" name="noteref_60" href=
          "#note_60"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">60</span></span></a> clad
          in purple, governors and satraps, charming youths all of them,
          horsemen riding on horses; and she lavished on them her
          fornications, the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">élite</span></span> of the sons of Asshur all
          of them, and with all the idols of all on whom she doted she
          defiled herself”</span> (vv. 6, 7). The first intimate contact of
          North Israel with Assyria was in the reign of Menahem (2 Kings xv.
          19), and the explanation of it given in these words of Ezekiel must
          be historically true. It was the magnificent equipment of the
          Assyrian armies, the imposing display of military power which their
          appearance suggested, that impressed the politicians of Samaria
          with a sense of the value of their alliance. The passage
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page193">[pg 193]</span><a name=
          "Pg193" id="Pg193" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> therefore throws
          light on what Ezekiel and the prophets generally mean by the figure
          of <span class="tei tei-q">“whoredom.”</span> What he chiefly
          deplores is the introduction of Assyrian idolatry, which was the
          inevitable sequel to a political union. But that was a secondary
          consideration in the intention of those who were responsible for
          the alliance. The real motive of their policy was undoubtedly the
          desire of one party in the state to secure the powerful aid of the
          king of Assyria against the rival party. None the less it was an
          act of infidelity and rebellion against Jehovah.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Still more
          striking is the account of the first approaches of the southern
          kingdom to Babylon. After Samaria had been destroyed by the lovers
          whom she had gathered to her side, Jerusalem still kept up the
          illicit connection with the Assyrian empire. After Assyria had
          vanished from the stage of history, she eagerly sought an
          opportunity to enter into friendly relations with the new
          Babylonian empire. She did not even wait till she had made their
          acquaintance, but <span class="tei tei-q">“when she saw men
          portrayed on the wall, pictures of Chaldæans portrayed in
          vermilion, girt with waist-cloths on their loins, with flowing
          turbans on their heads, all of them champions to look upon, the
          likeness of the sons of Babel whose native land is Chaldæa—then she
          doted upon them when she saw them with her eyes, and sent
          messengers to them to Chaldæa”</span> (vv. 14-16). The brilliant
          pictures referred to are those with which Ezekiel must have been
          familiar on the walls of the temples and palaces of Babylon. The
          representation, however, cannot be understood literally, since the
          Jews could have had no opportunity of even seeing the Babylonian
          pictures <span class="tei tei-q">“on the wall”</span> until they
          had sent ambassadors there.<a id="noteref_61" name="noteref_61"
          href="#note_61"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">61</span></span></a></p><span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page194">[pg 194]</span><a name="Pg194" id="Pg194" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The meaning of
          the prophet is clear. The mere report of the greatness of Babylon
          was sufficient to excite the passions of Oholibah, and she began
          with blind infatuation to court the advances of the distant
          strangers who were to be her ruin. The exact historic reference,
          however, is uncertain. It cannot be to the compact between
          Merodach-baladan and Hezekiah, since at that time the initiative
          seems to have been taken by the rebel prince, whose sovereignty
          over Babylon proved to be of short duration. It may rather be some
          transaction about the time of the battle of Carchemish (604) that
          Ezekiel is thinking of; but we have not as yet sufficient knowledge
          of the circumstances to clear up the allusion.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before the end
          came the soul of Jerusalem was alienated from her latest
          lovers—another touch of fidelity to the historical situation. But
          it was now too late. The soul of Jehovah is alienated from Oholibah
          (vv. 17, 18), and she is already handed over to the fate which had
          overtaken her less guilty sister Ohola. The principal agents of her
          punishment are the Babylonians and all the Chaldæans; but under
          their banner marches a host of other nations—Pekod and Shoa and
          Koa,<a id="noteref_62" name="noteref_62" href=
          "#note_62"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">62</span></span></a> and,
          somewhat strangely, the sons of Asshur. In the pomp and
          circumstance of war which had formerly fascinated her imagination,
          they shall come against her, and after their cruel manner execute
          upon her the judgment meted out to adulterous women: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister, and I will
          put her cup into thy hand. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, The cup of
          thy sister shalt thou drink,—deep and wide, and of large
          content,—filled with drunkenness and anguish—the cup of horror and
          desolation, the cup of thy sister Samaria. And thou shalt drink
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page195">[pg 195]</span><a name=
          "Pg195" id="Pg195" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> it and drain it
          out,<a id="noteref_63" name="noteref_63" href=
          "#note_63"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">63</span></span></a> ...
          for I have spoken it, saith the Lord Jehovah”</span> (vv.
          31-34).</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Up to this point
          the allegory has closely followed the actual history of the two
          kingdoms. The remainder of the chapter (vv. 36-49) forms a pendant
          to the principal picture, and works out the central theme from a
          different point of view. Here Samaria and Jerusalem are regarded as
          still existent, and judgment is pronounced on both as if it were
          still future. This is thoroughly in keeping with Ezekiel's ideal
          delineations. The limitations of space and time are alike
          transcended. The image, once clearly conceived, fixes itself in the
          writer's mind, and must be allowed to exhaust its meaning before it
          is finally dismissed. The distinctions of far and near, of past and
          present and future, are apt to disappear in the intensity of his
          reverie. It is so here. The figures of Ohola and Oholibah are so
          real to the prophet that they are summoned once more to the
          tribunal to hear the recital of their <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“abominations”</span> and receive the sentence which
          has in fact been already partly executed. Whether he is thinking at
          all of the ten tribes then in exile and awaiting further punishment
          it would be difficult to say. We see, however, that the picture is
          enriched with many features for which there was no room in the more
          historic form of the allegory, and perhaps the desire for
          completeness was the chief motive for thus amplifying the figure.
          The description of the conduct of the two harlots (vv. 40-44) is
          exceedingly graphic,<a id="noteref_64" name="noteref_64" href=
          "#note_64"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">64</span></span></a> and is
          no doubt a piece of realism drawn from life. Otherwise the section
          contains nothing that <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page196">[pg
          196]</span><a name="Pg196" id="Pg196" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          calls for elucidation. The ideas are those which we have already

          are placed presents no element of novelty.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus with words
          of judgment, and without a ray of hope to lighten the darkness of
          the picture, the prophet closes this last survey of his people's
          history.</p>

          Jerusalem. Chapters xxii., xxiv.</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The close of the
          first period of Ezekiel's work was marked by two dramatic
          incidents, which made the day memorable both in the private life of
          the prophet and in the history of the nation. In the first place it
          coincided exactly with the commencement of the siege of Jerusalem.
          The prophet's mysterious knowledge of what was happening at a
          distance was duly recorded, in order that its subsequent
          confirmation through the ordinary channels of intelligence might
          prove the divine origin of his message (ch. xxiv. 1, 2). That
          Ezekiel actually did this we have no reason to doubt. Then the
          sudden death of his wife on the evening of the same day, and his
          unusual behaviour under the bereavement, caused a sensation among
          the exiles which the prophet was instructed to utilise as a means
          of driving home the appeal just made to them. These transactions
          must have had a profound effect on Ezekiel's fellow-captives. They
          made his personality the centre of absorbing interest to the Jews
          in Babylon; and the two years of silence on his part which ensued
          were to them years of anxious foreboding about the result of the
          siege.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At this juncture
          the prophet's thoughts naturally are occupied with the subject
          which hitherto formed the principal burden of his prophecy. The
          first part of his career accordingly closes, as it had begun, with
          a symbol <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page198">[pg
          198]</span><a name="Pg198" id="Pg198" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          of the fall of Jerusalem. Before this, however, he had drawn out
          the solemn indictment against Jerusalem which is given in ch.
          xxii., although the finishing touches were probably added after the
          destruction of the city. The substance of that chapter is so
          closely related to the symbolic representation in the first part of
          ch. xxiv. that it will be convenient to consider it here as an
          introduction to the concluding oracles addressed more directly to
          the exiles of Tel-abib.</p>

          <div class="tei tei-div" style=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The purpose of
            this arraignment—the most stately of Ezekiel's orations—is to
            exhibit Jerusalem in her true character as a city whose social
            condition is incurably corrupt. It begins with an enumeration of
            the prevalent sins of the capital (vv. 2-16); it ends with a
            denunciation of the various classes into which society was
            divided (vv. 23-31); while the short intervening passage is a
            figurative description of the judgment which is now inevitable
            (vv. 17-22).</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">1. The first
            part of the chapter, then, is a catalogue of the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“abominations”</span> which called down the vengeance
            of Heaven upon the city of Jerusalem. The offences enumerated are
            nearly the same as those mentioned in the definitions of personal
            righteousness and wickedness given in ch. xviii. It is not
            necessary to repeat what was there said about the characteristics
            of the moral ideal which had been formed in the mind of Ezekiel.
            Although he is dealing now with a society, his point of view is
            quite different from that represented by purely allegorical
            passages like chs. xvi. and xxiii. The city is not idealised and
            treated as a moral individual, whose relations to Jehovah have to
            be set forth in symbolic and figurative language. It is conceived
            as an aggregate of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page199">[pg
            199]</span><a name="Pg199" id="Pg199" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            individuals bound together in social relations; and the sins
            charged against it are the actual transgressions of the men who
            are members of the community. Hence the standard of public
            morality is precisely the same as that which is elsewhere applied
            to the individual in his personal relation to God; and the sins
            enumerated are attributed to the city merely because they are
            tolerated and encouraged in individuals by laxity of public
            opinion and the force of evil example. Jerusalem is a community
            in which these different crimes are perpetrated: <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Father and mother are despised <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in
            thee</span></em>; the stranger is oppressed <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in the midst of
            thee</span></em>; orphan and widow are wronged <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in
            thee</span></em>; slanderous men seeking blood have been
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in
            thee</span></em>; flesh with the blood is eaten <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in

            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in the midst of
            thee</span></em>; the father's shame is uncovered <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in
            thee</span></em>; she that was unclean in her separation hath
            been humbled <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">in thee</span></em>.”</span> So the grave
            and measured indictment runs on. It is because of these things
            that Jerusalem as a whole is <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“guilty”</span> and <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“unclean”</span> and has brought near her day of
            retribution (ver. 4). Such a conception of corporate guilt
            undoubtedly appeals more directly to our ordinary conscience of
            public morality than the more poetic representations where
            Jerusalem is compared to a faithless and treacherous woman. We
            have no difficulty in judging of any modern city in the very same
            way as Ezekiel here judges Jerusalem; and in this respect it is
            interesting to notice the social evils which he regards as
            marking out that city as ripe for destruction.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are
            three features of the state of things in Jerusalem in which the
            prophet recognises the symptoms of an incurable social condition.
            The first is the loss of a true conception of God. In ancient
            Israel this defect necessarily assumed the form of idolatry.
            Hence the multiplication of idols appropriately finds a place
            among the marks of the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“uncleanness”</span> which made Jerusalem hateful
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page200">[pg 200]</span><a name=
            "Pg200" id="Pg200" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> in the eyes of
            Jehovah (ver. 3). But the root of idolatry in Israel was the
            incapacity or the unwillingness of the people to live up to the
            lofty conception of the divine nature which was taught by the
            prophets. Throughout the ancient world religion was felt to be
            the indispensable bond of society, and the gods that were
            worshipped reflected more or less fully the ideals that swayed
            the life of the community. To Israel the religion of Jehovah
            represented the highest social ideal that was then known on
            earth. It meant righteousness, and purity, and brotherhood, and
            compassion for the poor and distressed. When these virtues
            decayed she forgot Jehovah (ver. 12)—forgot His character even if
            she remembered His name—and the service of false gods was the
            natural and obvious expression of the fact. There is therefore a
            profound truth in Ezekiel's mind when he numbers the idols of
            Jerusalem amongst the indications of a degenerate society. They
            were the evidence that she had lost the sense of God as a holy
            and righteous spiritual presence in her midst, and that loss was
            at once the source and the symptom of widespread moral
            declension. It is one of the chief lessons of the Old Testament
            that a religion which was neither the product of national genius
            nor the embodiment of national aspiration, but was based on
            supernatural revelation, proved itself in the history of Israel
            to be the only possible safeguard against the tendencies which
            made for social disintegration.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A second mark
            of depravity which Ezekiel discovers in the capital is the
            perversion of certain moral instincts which are just as essential
            to the preservation of society as a true conception of God. For
            if society rests at one end on religion, it rests at the other on
            instinct. The closest and most fundamental of human relations
            depend on innate perceptions which may be easily destroyed, but
            which when destroyed can scarcely be recovered. The <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page201">[pg 201]</span><a name="Pg201" id=
            "Pg201" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> sanctities of marriage and
            the family will hardly bear the coarse scrutiny of utilitarian
            ethics; yet they are the foundation on which the whole social
            fabric is built. And there is no part of Ezekiel's indictment of
            Jerusalem which conveys to our minds a more vivid sense of utter
            corruption than where he speaks of the loss of filial piety and
            revolting forms of sexual impurity as prevalent sins in the city.
            Here at least he carries the conviction of every moralist with
            him. He instances no offence of this kind which would not be
            branded as unnatural by any system of ethics as heartily as it is
            by the Old Testament. It is possible, on the other hand, that he
            ranks on the same level with these sins ceremonial impurities
            appealing to feelings of a different order, to which no permanent
            moral value can be attached. When, for example, he instances
            eating with the blood<a id="noteref_65" name="noteref_65" href=
            "#note_65"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">65</span></span></a> as
            an <span class="tei tei-q">“abomination,”</span> he appeals to a
            law which is no longer binding on us. But even that regulation
            was not so worthless, from a moral point of view, at that time as
            we are apt to suppose. The abhorrence of eating blood was
            connected with certain sacrificial ideas which attributed a
            mystic significance to the blood as the seat of animal life. So
            long as these ideas existed no man could commit this offence
            without injuring his moral nature and loosening the divine
            sanctions of morality as a whole. It is a false illuminism which
            seeks to disparage the moral insight of the prophet on the ground
            that he did not teach an abstract system of ethics in which
            ceremonial precepts were sharply distinguished from duties which
            we consider moral.<a id="noteref_66" name="noteref_66" href=
            "#note_66"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">66</span></span></a></p><span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page202">[pg 202]</span><a name="Pg202" id="Pg202" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The third
            feature of Jerusalem's guilty condition is lawless violation of
            human rights. Neither life nor property was secure. Judicial
            murders were frequent in the city, and minor forms of oppression,
            such as usury, spoliation of the unprotected, and robbery, were
            of daily occurrence. The administration of justice was corrupted
            by systematic bribery and perjury, and the lives of innocent men
            were ruthlessly sacrificed under the forms of law. This after all
            is the aspect of things which bulks most largely in the prophet's
            indictment. Jerusalem is addressed as a <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“city shedding blood in her midst,”</span> and
            throughout the accusation the charge of bloodshed is that which
            constantly recurs. Misgovernment and party strife, and perhaps
            religious persecution, had converted the city into a vast human
            shambles, and the blood of the innocent slain cried aloud to
            heaven for vengeance. <span class="tei tei-q">“Of what
            avail,”</span> asks the prophet, <span class="tei tei-q">“are the
            stores of wealth piled up in the hands of a few against this
            damning witness of blood? Jehovah smites His hand [in derision]
            against her gains that she has made, and against her blood which
            is in her midst. How can her heart stand or her hands be strong
            in the days when He deals with her?”</span> (vv. 13, 14). Drained
            of her best blood, given over to internecine strife, and stricken
            with the cowardice of conscious guilt, Jerusalem, already
            disgraced among the nations, must fall an easy victim to the
            Chaldæan invaders, who are the agents of Jehovah's judgments.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">2. But the
            most serious aspect of the situation is that which is dealt with
            in the peroration of the chapter (vv. 23-31). Outbursts of vice
            and lawlessness such as has been described may occur in any
            society, but they are not necessarily fatal to a community so
            long as it possesses a conscience which can be roused to
            effective protest against them. Now the worst thing about
            Jerusalem was that she lacked this indispensable condition
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page203">[pg 203]</span><a name=
            "Pg203" id="Pg203" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of recovery. No
            voice was raised on the side of righteousness, no man dared to
            stem the tide of wickedness that swept through her streets. Not
            merely that she harboured within her walls men guilty of incest
            and robbery and murder, but that her leading classes were
            demoralised, that public spirit had decayed among her citizens,
            marked her as incapable of reformation. She was <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“a land not watered,”</span><a id="noteref_67" name=
            "noteref_67" href="#note_67"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

            <span class="tei tei-q">“and not rained upon in a day of
            indignation”</span> (ver. 24); the springs of her civic virtue
            were dried up, and a blight spread through all sections of her
            population.<a id="noteref_68" name="noteref_68" href=
            "#note_68"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">68</span></span></a>
            Ezekiel's impeachment of different classes of society brings out
            this fact with great force. First of all the ancient institutions
            of social order, government, priesthood, and prophecy were in the
            hands of men who had lost the spirit of their office and abused
            their position for the advancement of private interests. Her
            princes<a id="noteref_69" name="noteref_69" href=
            "#note_69"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">69</span></span></a> have
            been, instead of humane rulers and examples of noble living,
            cruel and rapacious tyrants, enriching themselves at the cost of
            their subjects (ver. 25). The priests, whose function was to
            maintain the outward ordinances of religion and foster the spirit
            of reverence, have done their utmost, by falsification of the
            <span lang="he" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "he"><span style="font-style: italic">Torah</span></span>, to
            bring religion into contempt and obliterate the distinction
            between the holy and the profane (ver. 26). The nobles had been a
            pack of ravening wolves, imitating the rapacity of the court, and
            hunting down prey which the royal lion would have disdained to
            touch (ver. 27). As for the professional <span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page204">[pg 204]</span><a name="Pg204" id="Pg204" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> prophets—those degenerate representatives
            of the old champions of truth and mercy—we have already seen what
            they were worth (ch. xiii.). They who should have been foremost
            to denounce civil wrong are fit for nothing but to stand by and
            bolster up with lying oracles in the name of Jehovah a
            constitution which sheltered crimes like these (ver. 28).</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From the
            ruling classes the prophet's glance turns for a moment to the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“people of the land,”</span> the dim
            common population, where virtue might have been expected to find
            its last retreat. It is characteristic of the age of Ezekiel that
            the prophets begin to deal more particularly with the sins of the
            masses as distinct from the classes. This was due partly perhaps
            to a real increase of ungodliness in the body of the people, but
            partly also to a deeper sense of the importance of the individual
            apart from his position in the state. These prophets seem to feel
            that if there had been anywhere among rich or poor an honest
            response to the will of Jehovah it would have been a token that
            God had not altogether rejected Israel. Jeremiah puts this view
            very strongly when in the fifth chapter he says that if one man
            could be found in Jerusalem who did justice and sought truth the
            Lord would pardon her; and his vain search for that man begins
            among the poor. It is this same motive that leads Ezekiel to
            include the humble citizen in his survey of the moral condition
            of Jerusalem. It is little wonder that under such leaders they
            had cast off the restraints of humanity, and oppressed those who
            were still more defenceless than themselves. But it showed
            nevertheless that real religion had no longer a foothold in the
            city. It proved that the greed of gain had eaten into the very
            heart of the people and destroyed the ties of kindred and mutual
            sympathy, through which alone the will of Jehovah could be
            realised. No matter although they <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page205">[pg 205]</span><a name="Pg205" id="Pg205" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> were obscure householders, without
            political power or responsibility; if they had been good men in
            their private relations, Jerusalem would have been a better place
            to live in. Ezekiel indeed does not go so far as to say that a
            single good life would have saved the city. He expects of a good
            man that he be a man in the full sense—a man who speaks boldly on
            behalf of righteousness and resists the prevalent evils with all
            his strength: <span class="tei tei-q">“I sought among them a man
            to build up a fence, and to stand in the breach before Me on
            behalf of the land, that it might not be destroyed; and I found
            none. So I poured out My indignation upon them; with the fire of
            My wrath I consumed them: I have returned their way upon their
            head, saith the Lord Jehovah”</span> (vv. 30, 31).</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">3. But we
            should misunderstand Ezekiel's position if we supposed that his
            prediction of the speedy destruction of Jerusalem was merely an
            inference from his clear insight into the necessary conditions of
            social welfare which were being violated by her rulers and her
            citizens. That is one part of his message, but it could not stand
            alone. The purpose of the indictment we have considered is simply
            to explain the moral reasonableness of Jehovah's action in the
            great act of judgment which the prophet knows to be approaching.
            It is no doubt a general law of history that moribund communities
            are not allowed to die a natural death. Their usual fate is to
            perish in the struggle for existence before some other and
            sounder nation. But no human sagacity can foresee how that law
            will be verified in any particular case. It may seem clear to us
            now that Israel must have fallen sooner or later before the
            advance of the great Eastern empires, but an ordinary observer
            could not have foretold with the confidence and precision which
            mark the predictions of Ezekiel in what manner and within what
            time the end would come. Of that aspect of the prophet's mind
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page206">[pg 206]</span><a name=
            "Pg206" id="Pg206" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> no explanation can
            be given save that God revealed His secret to His servants the
            prophets.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now this
            element of the prophecy seems to be brought out by the image of
            Jerusalem's fate which occupies the middle verses of the chapter
            (vv. 17-22). The city is compared to the crucible in which all
            the refuse of Israel's national life is to undergo its final
            trial by fire. The prophet sees in imagination the
            terror-stricken provincial population swept into the capital
            before the approach of the Chaldæans; and he says, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Thus does Jehovah cast His ore into the furnace—the
            silver, the brass, the iron, the lead, and the tin; and He will
            kindle the fire with His anger, and blow upon it till He have
            consumed the impurities of the land.”</span> The image of the
            smelting-pot had been used by Isaiah as an emblem of purifying
            judgment, the object of which was the removal of injustice and
            the restoration of the state to its former splendour:
            <span class="tei tei-q">“I will again bring My hand upon thee,
            smelting out thy dross with lye and taking away all thine alloy;
            and I will make thy judges to be again as aforetime, and thy
            counsellors as at the beginning: thereafter thou shalt be called
            the city of righteousness, the faithful city”</span> (Isa. i. 25,
            26). Ezekiel, however, can hardly have contemplated such a happy
            result of the operation. The whole house of Israel has become
            dross, from which no precious metal can be extracted; and the
            object of the smelting is only the demonstration of the utter
            worthlessness of the people for the ends of God's kingdom. The
            more refractory the material to be dealt with the fiercer must be
            the fire that tests it; and the severity of the exterminating
            judgment is the only thing symbolised by the metaphor as used by
            Ezekiel. In this he follows Jeremiah, who applies the figure in
            precisely the same sense: <span class="tei tei-q">“The bellows
            snort, the lead is consumed of the fire; in vain he smelts and
            smelts: but the wicked are not taken away. Refuse silver
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page207">[pg 207]</span><a name=
            "Pg207" id="Pg207" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> shall men call
            them, for the Lord hath rejected them”</span> (Jer. vi. 29, 30).
            In this way the section supplements the teaching of the rest of
            the chapter. Jerusalem is full of dross—that has been proved by
            the enumeration of her crimes and the estimate of her social
            condition. But the fire which consumes the dross represents a
            special providential intervention bringing the history of the
            state to a summary and decisive conclusion. And the Refiner who
            superintends the process is Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel,
            whose righteous will is executed by the march of conquering
            hosts, and revealed to men in His dealings with the people whom
            He had known of all the families of the earth.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The chapter we
            have just studied was evidently not composed with a view to
            immediate publication. It records the view of Jerusalem's guilt
            and punishment which was borne in upon the mind of the prophet in
            the solitude of his chamber, but it was not destined to see the
            light until the whole of his teaching could be submitted in its
            final form to a wider and more receptive audience. It is equally
            obvious that the scenes described in ch. xxiv. were really
            enacted in the full view of the exiled community. We have reached
            the crisis of Ezekiel's ministry. For the last time until his
            warnings of doom shall be fulfilled he emerges from his partial
            seclusion, and in symbolism whose vivid force could not have
            failed to impress the most listless hearer he announces once more
            the destruction of the Hebrew nation. The burden of his message
            is that that day—the tenth day of the tenth month of the ninth
            year—marked the beginning of the end. <span class="tei tei-q">“On
            that very day”</span>—a day to be commemorated for seventy long
            years by a national fast (Zech. viii. 19; <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page208">[pg 208]</span><a name="Pg208" id=
            "Pg208" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> cf. vii. 5)—Nebuchadnezzar
            was drawing his lines round Jerusalem. The bare announcement to
            men who knew what a Chaldæan siege meant must have sent a thrill
            of consternation through their minds. If this vision of what was
            happening in a distant land should prove true, they must have
            felt that all hope of deliverance was now cut off. Sceptical as
            they may have been of the moral principles that lay behind
            Ezekiel's prediction, they could not deny that the issue he
            foresaw was only the natural sequel to the fact he so confidently
            announced.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The image here
            used of the fate of Jerusalem would recall to the minds of the
            exiles the ill-omened saying which expressed the reckless spirit
            prevalent in the city: <span class="tei tei-q">“This city is the
            pot, and we are the flesh”</span> (ch. xi. 3). It was well
            understood in Babylon that these men were playing a desperate
            game, and did not shrink from the horrors of a siege.
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Set on the pot,”</span> then, cries the
            prophet to his listeners, <span class="tei tei-q">“set it on, and
            pour in water also, and gather the pieces into it, every good
            joint, leg and shoulder; fill it with the choicest bones. Take
            them from the best of the flock, and then pile up the wood<a id=
            "noteref_70" name="noteref_70" href="#note_70"><span class=

            under it; let its pieces be boiled and its bones cooked within
            it”</span> (vv. 3-5). This part of the parable required no
            explanation; it simply represents the terrible miseries endured
            by the population of Jerusalem during the siege now commencing.
            But then by a sudden transition the speaker turns the thoughts of
            his hearers to another aspect of the judgment (vv. 6-8). The city
            itself is like a rusty caldron, unfit for any useful purpose
            until by some means it has been cleansed from its impurity. It is
            as if the crimes that had been perpetrated in Jerusalem had
            stained her very stones with blood. She had not <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page209">[pg 209]</span><a name="Pg209" id=
            "Pg209" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> even taken steps to conceal
            the traces of her wickedness; they lie like blood on the bare
            rock, an open witness to her guilt. Often Jehovah had sought to
            purify her by more measured chastisements, but it has now been
            proved that <span class="tei tei-q">“her much rust will not go
            from her except by fire”</span><a id="noteref_71" name=
            "noteref_71" href="#note_71"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">71</span></span></a>
            (ver. 12). Hence the end of the siege will be twofold. First of
            all the contents of the caldron will be indiscriminately thrown
            out—a figure for the dispersion and captivity of the inhabitants;
            and then the pot must be set empty on the glowing coals till its
            rust is thoroughly burned out—a symbol of the burning of the city
            and its subsequent desolation (ver. 11). The idea that the
            material world may contract defilement through the sins of those
            who live in it is one that is hard for us to realise, but it is
            in keeping with the view of sin presented by Ezekiel, and indeed
            by the Old Testament generally. There are certain natural emblems
            of sin, such as uncleanness or disease or uncovered blood, etc.,
            which had to be largely used in order to educate men's moral
            perceptions. Partly these rest on the analogy between physical
            defect and moral evil; but partly, as here, they result from a
            strong sense of association between human deeds and their effects
            or circumstances. Jerusalem is unclean as a place where wicked
            deeds have been done, and even the destruction of the sinners
            cannot in the mind of Ezekiel clear her from the unhallowed
            associations of her history. She must lie empty and dreary for a
            generation, swept by the winds of heaven before devout Israelites
            can again twine their affections round the hope of her glorious
            future.<a id="noteref_72" name="noteref_72" href=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Even while
            delivering this message of doom to the people the prophet's heart
            was burdened by the presentiment of a great personal sorrow. He
            had received an intimation that his wife was to be taken from him
            by a sudden stroke, and along with the intimation a command to
            refrain from all the usual signs of mourning. <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“So I spake to the people”</span> (as recorded in vv.
            1-14) <span class="tei tei-q">“in the morning, and my wife died
            in the evening”</span> (ver. 18). Just one touch of tenderness
            escapes him in relating this mysterious occurrence. She was the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“delight of his eyes”</span>: that phrase
            alone reveals that there was a fountain of tears sealed up within
            the breast of this stern preacher. How the course of his life may
            have been influenced by a bereavement so strangely coincident
            with a change in his whole attitude to his people we cannot even
            surmise. Nor is it possible to say how far he merely used the
            incident to convey a lesson to the exiles, or how far his private
            grief was really swallowed up in concern for the calamity of his
            country. All we are told is that <span class="tei tei-q">“in the
            morning he did as he was commanded.”</span> He neither uttered
            loud lamentations, nor disarranged his raiment, nor covered his
            head, nor ate the <span class="tei tei-q">“bread of
            men,”</span><a id="noteref_73" name="noteref_73" href=
            "#note_73"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">73</span></span></a> nor
            adopted any of the customary signs of mourning for the dead. When
            the astonished neighbours inquire the meaning of his strange
            demeanour, he assures them that his conduct <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">now</span></em>
            is a sign of what theirs will be when his words have come true.
            When the tidings reach them that Jerusalem has actually fallen,
            when they realise how many interests dear to them have
            perished—the desolation of the sanctuary, the loss of their own
            sons and daughters—they will experience a sense of calamity which
            will <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page211">[pg
            211]</span><a name="Pg211" id="Pg211" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            instinctively discard all the conventional and even the natural
            expressions of grief. They shall neither mourn nor weep, but sit
            in dumb bewilderment, haunted by a dull consciousness of guilt
            which yet is far removed from genuine contrition of heart. They
            shall pine away in their iniquities. For while their sorrow will
            be too deep for words, it will not yet be the godly sorrow that
            worketh repentance. It will be the sullen despair and apathy of
            men disenchanted of the illusions on which their national life
            was based, of men left without hope and without God in the
            world.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here the
            curtain falls on the first act of Ezekiel's ministry. He appears
            to have retired for the space of two years into complete privacy,
            ceasing entirely his public appeals to the people, and waiting
            for the time of his vindication as a prophet. The sense of
            restraint under which he has hitherto exercised the function of a
            public teacher cannot be removed until the tidings have reached
            Babylon that the city has fallen. Meanwhile, with the delivery of
            this message, his contest with the unbelief of his
            fellow-captives comes to an end. But when that day arrives
            <span class="tei tei-q">“his mouth shall be open, and he shall be
            no more dumb.”</span> A new career will open out before him, in
            which he can devote all his powers of mind and heart to the
            inspiring work of reviving faith in the promises of God, and so
            building up a new Israel out of the ruins of the old.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next eight
          chapters (xxv.-xxxii.) form an intermezzo in the book of Ezekiel.
          They are inserted in this place with the obvious intention of
          separating the two sharply contrasted situations in which our
          prophet found himself before and after the siege of Jerusalem. The
          subject with which they deal is indeed an essential part of the
          prophet's message to his time, but it is separate from the central
          interest of the narrative, which lies in the conflict between the
          word of Jehovah in the hands of Ezekiel and the unbelief of the
          exiles among whom he lived. The perusal of this group of chapters
          is intended to prepare the reader for the completely altered
          conditions under which Ezekiel was to resume his public
          ministrations. The cycle of prophecies on foreign peoples is thus a
          sort of literary analogue of the period of suspense which
          interrupted the continuity of Ezekiel's work in the way we have
          seen. It marks the shifting of the scenes behind the curtain before
          the principal actors again step on the stage.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is natural
          enough to suppose that the prophet's mind was really occupied
          during this time with the fate of Israel's heathen neighbours; but
          that alone does not account for the grouping of the oracles before
          us in this particular section of the book. Not only do some of the
          chronological notices carry us far past the limit of the time
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page216">[pg 216]</span><a name=
          "Pg216" id="Pg216" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of silence referred
          to, but it will be found that nearly all these prophecies assume
          that the fall of Jerusalem is already known to the nations
          addressed. It is therefore a mistaken view which holds that in
          these chapters we have simply the result of Ezekiel's meditations
          during his period of enforced seclusion from public duty. Whatever
          the nature of his activity at this time may have been, the
          principle of arrangement here is not chronological, but literary;
          and no better motive for it can be suggested than the writer's
          sense of dramatic propriety in unfolding the significance of his
          prophetic life.</p>

          series of oracles against heathen nations, Ezekiel follows the
          example set by some of his greatest predecessors. The book of Amos,
          for example, opens with an impressive chapter of judgments on the
          peoples lying immediately round the borders of Palestine. The
          thundercloud of Jehovah's anger is represented as moving over the
          petty states of Syria before it finally breaks in all its fury over
          the two kingdoms of Judah and Israel. Similarly the books of Isaiah
          and Jeremiah contain continuous sections dealing with various
          heathen powers, while the book of Nahum is wholly occupied with a
          prediction of the ruin of the Assyrian empire. And these are but a
          few of the more striking instances of a phenomenon which is apt to
          cause perplexity to close and earnest students of the Old
          Testament. We have here to do, therefore, with a standing theme of
          Hebrew prophecy; and it may help us better to understand the
          attitude of Ezekiel if we consider for a moment some of the
          principles involved in this constant preoccupation of the prophets
          with the affairs of the outer world.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the outset it
          must be understood that prophecies of this kind form part of
          Jehovah's message to Israel. Although they are usually cast in the
          form of direct address to foreign peoples, this must not lead us to
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page217">[pg 217]</span><a name=
          "Pg217" id="Pg217" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> imagine that they
          were intended for actual publication in the countries to which they
          refer. A prophet's real audience always consisted of his own
          countrymen, whether his discourse was about themselves or about
          their neighbours. And it is easy to see that it was impossible to
          declare the purpose of God concerning Israel in words that came
          home to men's business and bosoms, without taking account of the
          state and the destiny of other nations. Just as it would not be
          possible nowadays to forecast the future of Egypt without alluding
          to the fate of the Ottoman empire, so it was not possible then to
          describe the future of Israel in the concrete manner characteristic
          of the prophets without indicating the place reserved for those
          peoples with whom it had close intercourse. Besides this, a large
          part of the national consciousness of Israel was made up of
          interests, friendly or the reverse, in neighbouring states. The
          Hebrews had a keen eye for national idiosyncrasies, and the simple
          international relations of those days were almost as vivid and
          personal as of neighbours living in the same village. To be an
          Israelite was to be something characteristically different from a
          Moabite, and that again from an Edomite or a Philistine, and every
          patriotic Israelite had a shrewd sense of what the difference was.
          We cannot read the utterances of the prophets with regard to any of
          these nationalities without seeing that they often appeal to
          perceptions deeply lodged in the popular mind, which could be
          utilised to convey the spiritual lessons which the prophets desired
          to teach.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It must not be
          supposed, however, that such prophecies are in any degree the
          expression of national vanity or jealousy. What the prophets aim at
          is to elevate the thoughts of Israel to the sphere of eternal
          truths of the kingdom of God; and it is only in so far as these can
          be made to touch the conscience of the nation at this point that
          they appeal to what we may call its international <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page218">[pg 218]</span><a name="Pg218" id="Pg218"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> sentiments. Now the question we have to
          ask is, What spiritual purpose for Israel is served by the
          announcements of the destiny of the outlying heathen populations?
          There are of course special interests attaching to each particular
          prophecy which it would be difficult to classify. But, speaking
          generally, prophecies of this class had a moral value for two
          reasons. In the first place they re-echo and confirm the sentence
          of judgment passed on Israel herself. They do this in two ways:
          they illustrate the principle on which Jehovah deals with His own
          people, and His character as the righteous judge of men. Israel was
          to be destroyed for her national sins, her contempt of Jehovah, and
          her breaches of the moral law. But other nations, though more
          excusable, were not less guilty than Israel. The same spirit of
          ungodliness, in different forms, was manifested by Tyre, by Egypt,
          by Assyria, and by the petty states of Syria. Hence, if Jehovah was
          really the righteous ruler of the world, He must visit upon these
          nations their iniquities. Wherever a <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“sinful kingdom”</span> was found, whether in Israel or
          elsewhere, that kingdom must be removed from its place among the
          nations. This appears most clearly in the book of Amos, who, though
          he enunciates the paradoxical truth that Israel's sin must be
          punished just because it was the only people that Jehovah had
          known, nevertheless, as we have seen, thundered forth similar
          judgments on other nations for their flagrant violation of the
          universal law written in the human heart. In this way therefore the
          prophets enforced on their contemporaries the fundamental lesson of
          their teaching that the disasters which were coming on them were
          not the result of the caprice or impotence of their Deity, but the
          execution of His moral purpose, to which all men everywhere are
          subject. But again, not only was the principle of the judgment
          emphasised, but the manner in which it was to be carried out was
          more clearly exhibited. In all cases <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page219">[pg 219]</span><a name="Pg219" id="Pg219" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> the pre-exilic prophets announce that the
          overthrow of the Hebrew states was to be effected either by the
          Assyrians or the Babylonians. These great world-powers were in
          succession the instruments fashioned and used by Jehovah for the
          performance of His great work in the earth. Now it was manifest
          that if this anticipation was well founded it involved the
          overthrow of all the nations in immediate contact with Israel. The
          policy of the Mesopotamian monarchs was well understood; and if
          their wonderful successes were the revelation of the divine
          purpose, then Israel would not be judged alone. Accordingly we find
          in most instances that the chastisement of the heathen is either
          ascribed directly to the invaders or else to other agencies set in
          motion by their approach. The people of Israel or Judah were thus
          taught to look on their fate as involved in a great scheme of
          divine providence, overturning all the existing relations which
          gave them a place among the nations of the world and preparing for
          a new development of the purpose of Jehovah in the future.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When we turn to
          that ideal future we find a second and more suggestive aspect of
          these prophecies against the heathen. All the prophets teach that
          the destiny of Israel is inseparably bound up with the future of
          God's kingdom on earth. The Old Testament never wholly shakes off
          the idea that the preservation and ultimate victory of the true
          religion demands the continued existence of the one people to whom
          the revelation of the true God had been committed. The
          indestructibility of Israel's national life depends on its unique
          position in relation to the purposes of Jehovah, and it is for this
          reason that the prophets look forward with unwavering confidence to
          a time when the knowledge of Jehovah shall go forth from Israel to
          all the nations of mankind. And this point of view we must try to
          enter into if we are to understand the meaning of their
          declarations concerning the fate of the surrounding <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page220">[pg 220]</span><a name="Pg220" id="Pg220"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> nations. If we ask whether an
          independent future is reserved in the new dispensation for the
          peoples with whom Israel had dealings in the past, we find that
          different and sometimes conflicting answers are given. Thus Isaiah
          predicts a restoration of Tyre after the lapse of seventy years,
          while Ezekiel announces its complete and final destruction. It is
          only when we consider these utterances in the light of the
          prophets' general conception of the kingdom of God that we discern
          the spiritual truth that gives them an abiding significance for the
          instruction of all ages. It was not a matter of supreme religious
          importance to know whether Phœnicia or Egypt or Assyria would
          retain their old place in the world, and share indirectly in the
          blessings of the Messianic age. What men needed to be taught then,
          and what we need to remember still, is that each nation holds its
          position in subordination to the ends of God's government, that no
          power or wisdom or refinement will save a state from destruction
          when it ceases to serve the interests of His kingdom. The foreign
          peoples that come under the survey of the prophets are as yet
          strangers to the true God, and are therefore destitute of that
          which could secure them a place in the reconstruction of political
          relationships of which Israel is to be the religious centre.
          Sometimes they are represented as having by their hostility to
          Israel or their pride of heart so encroached on the sovereignty of
          Jehovah that their doom is already sealed. At other times they are
          conceived as converted to the knowledge of the true God, and as
          gladly accepting the place assigned to them in the humanity of the
          future by consecrating their wealth and power to the service of His
          people Israel. In all cases it is their attitude to Israel and the
          God of Israel that determines their destiny: that is the great
          truth which the prophets design to impress on their countrymen. So
          long as the cause of religion was identified with the fortunes
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page221">[pg 221]</span><a name=
          "Pg221" id="Pg221" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of the people of
          Israel no higher conception of the redemption of mankind could be
          formed than that of a willing subjection of the nations of the
          earth to the word of Jehovah which went forth from Jerusalem (cf.
          Isa. ii. 2-4). And whether any particular nation should survive to
          participate in the glories of that latter day depends on the view
          taken of its present condition and its fitness for incorporation in
          the universal empire of Jehovah soon to be established.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We now know that
          this was not the form in which Jehovah's purpose of salvation was
          destined to be realised in the history of the world. Since the
          coming of Christ the people of Israel has lost its distinctive and
          central position as the bearer of the hopes and promises of the
          true religion. In its place we have a spiritual kingdom of men
          united by faith in Jesus Christ, and in the worship of one Father
          in spirit and in truth—a kingdom which from its very nature can
          have no local centre or political organisation. Hence the
          conversion of the heathen can no longer be conceived as national
          homage paid to the seat of Jehovah's sovereignty on Zion; nor is
          the unfolding of the divine plan of universal salvation bound up
          with the extinction of the nationalities which once symbolised the
          hostility of the world to the kingdom of God. This fact has an
          important bearing on the question of the fulfilment of the foreign
          prophecies of the Old Testament. Literal fulfilment is not to be
          looked for in this case any more than in the delineations of
          Israel's future, which are after all the predominant element of
          Messianic prediction. It is true that the nations passed under
          review have now vanished from history, and in so far as their fall
          was brought about by causes operating in the world in which the
          prophets moved, it must be recognised as a partial but real
          vindication of the truth of their words. But the details of the
          prophecies have not been historically verified. <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page222">[pg 222]</span><a name="Pg222" id="Pg222"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> All attempts to trace their
          accomplishment in events that took place long afterwards and in
          circumstances which the prophets themselves never contemplated only
          lead us astray from the real interest which belongs to them. As
          concrete embodiments of the eternal principles exhibited in the
          rise and fall of nations they have an abiding significance for the
          Church in all ages; but the actual working out of these principles
          in history could not in the nature of things be complete within the
          limits of the world known to the inhabitants of Judæa. If we are to
          look for their ideal fulfilment, we shall only find it in the
          progressive victory of Christianity over all forms of error and
          superstition, and in the dedication of all the resources of human
          civilisation—its wealth, its commercial enterprise, its political
          power—to the advancement of the kingdom of our God and His
          Christ.</p>

          <div class="tei tei-tb">

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was natural
          from the special circumstances in which he wrote, as well as from
          the general character of his teaching, that Ezekiel, in his oracles
          against the heathen powers, should present only the dark side of
          God's providence. Except in the case of Egypt, the nations
          addressed are threatened with annihilation, and even Egypt is to be
          reduced to a condition of utter impotence and humiliation. Very
          characteristic also is his representation of the purpose which
          comes to light in this series of judgments. It is to be a great
          demonstration to all the earth of the absolute sovereignty of
          Jehovah. <span class="tei tei-q">“Ye shall know that I am
          Jehovah”</span> is the formula that sums up the lesson of each
          nation's fall. We observe that the prophet starts from the
          situation created by the fall of Jerusalem. That great calamity
          bore in the first instance the appearance of a triumph of
          heathenism over Jehovah the God of Israel. It was, as the prophet
          elsewhere expresses it, a profanation of His holy name in the eyes
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page223">[pg 223]</span><a name=
          "Pg223" id="Pg223" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of the nations. And
          in this light it was undoubtedly regarded by the petty
          principalities around Palestine, and perhaps also by the more
          distant and powerful spectators, such as Tyre and Egypt. From the
          standpoint of heathenism the downfall of Israel meant the defeat of
          its tutelary Deity; and the neighbouring nations, in exulting over
          the tidings of Jerusalem's fate, had in their minds the idea of the
          prostrate Jehovah unable to save His people in their hour of need.
          It is not necessary to suppose that Ezekiel attributes to them any
          consciousness of Jehovah's claim to be the only living and true
          God. It is the paradox of revelation that He who is the Eternal and
          Infinite first revealed Himself to the world as the God of Israel;
          and all the misconceptions that sprang out of that fact had to be
          cleared away by His self-manifestation in historical acts that
          appealed to the world at large. Amongst these acts the judgment of
          the heathen nations holds the first place in the mind of Ezekiel. A
          crisis has been reached at which it becomes necessary for Jehovah
          to vindicate His divinity by the destruction of those who have
          exalted themselves against Him. The world must learn once for all
          that Jehovah is no mere tribal god, but the omnipotent ruler of the
          universe. And this is the preparation for the final disclosure of
          His power and Godhead in the restoration of Israel to its own land,
          which will speedily follow the overthrow of its ancient foes. This
          series of prophecies forms thus an appropriate introduction to the
          third division of the book, which deals with the formation of the
          new people of Jehovah.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is somewhat
          remarkable that Ezekiel's survey of the heathen nations is
          restricted to those in the immediate vicinity of the land of
          Canaan. Although he had unrivalled opportunities of becoming
          acquainted with the remote countries of the East, he confines his
          attention to the Mediterranean states which had long played a part
          in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page224">[pg 224]</span><a name=
          "Pg224" id="Pg224" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Hebrew history. The
          peoples dealt with are seven in number—Ammon, Moab, Edom, the
          Philistines, Tyre, Sidon, and Egypt. The order of the enumeration
          is geographical: first the inner circle of Israel's immediate
          neighbours, from Ammon on the east round to Sidon in the extreme
          north; then outside the circle the preponderating world-power of
          Egypt. It is not altogether an accidental circumstance that five of
          these nations are named in the twenty-seventh chapter of Jeremiah
          as concerned in the project of rebellion against Nebuchadnezzar in
          the early part of Zedekiah's reign. Egypt and Philistia are not
          mentioned there, but we may surmise at least that Egyptian
          diplomacy was secretly at work pulling the wires which set the
          puppets in motion. This fact, together with the omission of Babylon
          from the list of threatened nations, shows that Ezekiel regards the
          judgment as falling within the period of Chaldæan supremacy, which
          he appears to have estimated at forty years. What is to be the fate
          of Babylon itself he nowhere intimates, a conflict between that
          great world-power and Jehovah's purpose being no part of his
          system. That Nebuchadnezzar is to be the agent of the overthrow of
          Tyre and the humiliation of Egypt is expressly stated; and although
          the crushing of the smaller states is ascribed to other agencies,
          we can hardly doubt that these were conceived as indirect
          consequences of the upheaval caused by the Babylonian invasion.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Ch. xxv., then,
          consists of four brief prophecies addressed respectively to Ammon,
          Moab, Edom, and the Philistines. A few words on the fate prefigured
          for each of these countries will suffice for the explanation of the
          chapter.</p>

          edge of the desert, between the upper waters of the Jabbok and the
          Arnon, separated from the Jordan by a strip of Israelitish
          territory from twenty to thirty miles wide. Its capital, Rabbah,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page225">[pg 225]</span><a name=
          "Pg225" id="Pg225" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> mentioned here (ver.
          5), was situated on a southern tributary of the Jabbok, and its
          ruins still bear amongst the Arabs the ancient national name
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Ammân</span></span>. Although their country
          was pastoral (milk is referred to in ver. 4 as one of its chief
          products), the Ammonites seem to have made some progress in
          civilisation. Jeremiah (ch. xlix. 4) speaks of them as trusting in
          their treasures; and in this chapter Ezekiel announces that they
          shall be for a spoil to the nations (ver. 7). After the deportation
          of the transjordanic tribes by Tiglath-pileser, Ammon seized the
          country that had belonged to the tribe of Gad, its nearest
          neighbour on the west. This encroachment is denounced by the
          prophet Jeremiah in the opening words of his oracle against Ammon:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Hath Israel no children? or has he no
          heir? why doth Milcom [the national deity of the Ammonites] inherit
          Gad, why hath his [Milcom's] folk settled in his [Gad's]
          cities”</span> (Jer. xlix. 1). We have already seen (ch. xxi.) that
          the Ammonites took part in the rebellion against Nebuchadnezzar,
          and stood out after the other members of the league had gone back
          from their purpose. But this temporary union with Jerusalem did
          nothing to abate the old national animosity, and the disaster of
          Judah was the signal for an exhibition of malignant satisfaction on
          the part of Ammon. <span class="tei tei-q">“Because thou hast said,
          Aha, against My sanctuary when it was profaned, and the land of
          Israel when it was laid waste, and the house of Judah when it went
          into captivity,”</span> etc. (ver. 3)—for this crowning offence
          against the majesty of Jehovah, Ezekiel denounces an exterminating
          judgment on Ammon. The land shall be given up to the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“children of the East”</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,

          eating its fruits and drinking its milk, and turning the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“great city”</span> Rabbah itself into a
          resting-place for camels (vv. 4, 5). It is not quite clear (though
          it is commonly assumed) that the children of the East are
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page226">[pg 226]</span><a name=

          actual conquerors of Ammon. Their possession of the country may be
          the consequence rather than the cause of the destruction of
          civilisation, the encroachment of the nomads being as inevitable
          under these circumstances as the extension of the desert itself
          where water fails.</p>

          8-11) comes next in order. Its proper territory, since the
          settlement of Israel in Canaan, was the elevated tableland south of
          the Arnon, along the lower part of the Dead Sea. But the tribe of
          Reuben, which bordered it on the north, was never able to hold its
          ground against the superior strength of Moab, and hence the latter
          nation is found in possession of the lower and more fertile
          district stretching northwards from the Arnon, now called the
          Belka. All the cities, indeed, which are mentioned in this chapter
          as belonging to Moab—Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon, and Kirjathaim—were
          situated in this northern and properly Israelite region. These were
          the <span class="tei tei-q">“glory of the land,”</span> which were
          now to be taken away from Moab (ver. 9). In Israel Moab appears to
          have been regarded as the incarnation of a peculiarly offensive
          form of national pride,<a id="noteref_75" name="noteref_75" href=
          "#note_75"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">75</span></span></a> of
          which we happen to have a monument in the famous Moabite Stone,
          which was erected by Mesha in the ninth century <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> to commemorate the
          victories of Chemosh over Jehovah and Israel. The inscription
          shows, moreover, that in the arts of civilised life Moab was at
          that early time no unworthy rival of Israel itself. It is for a
          special manifestation of this haughty and arrogant spirit in the
          day of Jerusalem's calamity that Ezekiel pronounces Jehovah's
          judgment on Moab: <span class="tei tei-q">“Because Moab hath said,
          Behold, the house of Judah is like all the nations”</span> (ver.
          8). These words no <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page227">[pg
          227]</span><a name="Pg227" id="Pg227" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          doubt reflect accurately the sentiment of Moab towards Israel, and
          they presuppose a consciousness on the part of Moab of some unique
          distinction pertaining to Israel in spite of all the humiliations
          it had undergone since the time of David. And the thought of Moab
          may have been more widely disseminated among the nations than we
          are apt to suppose: <span class="tei tei-q">“The kings of the earth
          believed not, neither all the inhabitants of the world, that the
          adversary and the enemy should enter into the gates of
          Jerusalem”</span> (Lam. iv. 12). The Moabites at all events
          breathed a sigh of relief when Israel's pretensions to religious
          ascendency seemed to be confuted, and thereby they sealed their own
          doom. They share the fate of the Ammonites, their land being handed
          over for a possession to the sons of the East (ver. 10).</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Both these
          nations, Ammon and Moab, were absorbed by the Arabs, as Ezekiel had
          foretold; but Ammon at least preserved its separate name and
          nationality through many changes of fortune down to the second
          century after Christ.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">3. <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">Edom</span></span> (vv. 12-14), famous
          in the Old Testament for its wisdom (Jer. xlix. 7; Obad. 8),
          occupied the country to the south of Moab from the Dead Sea to the
          head of the Gulf of Akaba. In Old Testament times the centre of its
          power was in the region to the east of the Arabah Valley, a
          position of great commercial importance, as commanding the caravan
          route from the Red Sea port of Elath to Northern Syria. From this
          district the Edomites were afterwards driven (about 300
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>) by the Arabian tribe
          of the Nabatæans, when they took up their abode in the south of
          Judah. None of the surrounding nations were so closely akin to
          Israel as Edom, and with none were its relations more embittered
          and hostile. The Edomites had been subjugated and nearly
          exterminated by David, had been again subdued by Amaziah and
          Uzziah, but finally recovered their <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page228">[pg 228]</span><a name="Pg228" id="Pg228" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> independence during the attack of the Syrians
          and Ephraimites on Judah in the reign of Ahaz. The memory of this
          long struggle produced in Edom a <span class="tei tei-q">“perpetual
          enmity,”</span> an undying hereditary hatred towards the kingdom of
          Judah. But that which made the name of Edom to be execrated by the
          later Jews was its conduct after the fall of Jerusalem. The prophet
          Obadiah represents it as sharing in the spoil of Jerusalem (ver.
          10), and as <span class="tei tei-q">“standing in the crossway to
          cut off those that escaped”</span> (ver. 14). Ezekiel also alludes
          to this in the thirty-fifth chapter (ver. 5), and tells us further
          that in the time of the captivity the Edomites seized part of the
          territory of Israel (vv. 10-12), from which indeed the Jews were
          never able altogether to dislodge them. For the guilt they thus
          incurred by taking advantage of the humiliation of Jehovah's
          people, Ezekiel here threatens them with extinction; and the
          execution of the divine vengeance is in their case entrusted to the
          children of Israel themselves (vv. 13, 14). They were, in fact,
          finally subdued by John Hyrcanus in 126 <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, and compelled to
          adopt the Jewish religion. But long before then they had lost their
          prestige and influence, their ancient seats having passed under the
          dominion of the Arabs in common with all the neighbouring
          countries.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">4. The
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">Philistines</span></span> (vv.
          15-17)—the <span class="tei tei-q">“immigrants”</span> who had
          settled along the Mediterranean coast, and who were destined to
          leave their name to the whole country—had evidently played a part
          very similar to the Edomites at the time of the destruction of
          Jerusalem; but of this nothing is known beyond what is here said by
          Ezekiel. They were at this time a mere <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“remnant”</span> (ver. 16), having been exhausted by
          the Assyrian and Egyptian wars. Their fate is not precisely
          indicated in the prophecy. They were in point of fact gradually
          extinguished by the revival of Jewish domination under the Asmonean
          dynasty.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One other remark
          may here be made, as showing the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page229">[pg 229]</span><a name="Pg229" id="Pg229" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> discrimination which Ezekiel brought to bear
          in estimating the characteristics of each separate nation. He does
          not ascribe to the greater powers, Tyre and Sidon and Egypt, the
          same petty and vindictive jealousy of Israel which actuated the
          diminutive nationalities dealt with in this chapter. These great
          heathen states, which played so imposing a part in ancient
          civilisation, had a wide outlook over the affairs of the world; and
          the injuries they inflicted on Israel were due less to the blind
          instinct of national hatred than to the pursuit of far-reaching
          schemes of selfish interest and aggrandisement. If Tyre rejoices
          over the fall of Jerusalem, it is because of the removal of an
          obstacle to the expansion of her commercial enterprise. When Egypt
          is described as having been an occasion of sin to the people of
          God, what is meant is that she had drawn Israel into the net of her
          ambitious foreign policy, and led her away from the path of safety
          pointed out by Jehovah's will through the prophets. Ezekiel pays a
          tribute to the grandeur of their position by the care he bestows on
          the description of their fate. The smaller nations embodying
          nothing of permanent value for the advancement of humanity, he
          dismisses each with a short and pregnant oracle announcing its
          doom. But when he comes to the fall of Tyre and of Egypt his
          imagination is evidently impressed; he lingers over all the details
          of the picture, he returns to it again and again, as if he would
          penetrate the secret of their greatness and understand the potent
          fascination which their names exercised throughout the world. It
          would be entirely erroneous to suppose that he sympathises with
          them in their calamity, but certainly he is conscious of the blank
          which will be caused by their disappearance from history; he feels
          that something will have vanished from the earth whose loss will be
          mourned by the nations far and near. This is most apparent in the
          prophecy on Tyre, to which we now proceed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the time of
          Ezekiel Tyre was still at the height of her commercial prosperity.
          Although not the oldest of the Phœnician cities, she held a
          supremacy among them which dated from the thirteenth century
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>,<a id="noteref_76"

          she had long been regarded as the typical embodiment of the genius
          of the remarkable race to which she belonged. The Phœnicians were
          renowned in antiquity for a combination of all the qualities on
          which commercial greatness depends. Their absorbing devotion to the
          material interests of civilisation, their amazing industry and
          perseverance, their resourcefulness in assimilating and improving
          the inventions of other peoples, the technical skill of their
          artists and craftsmen, but above all their adventurous and daring
          seamanship, conspired to give them a position in the old world such
          as has never been quite rivalled by any other nation of ancient or
          modern times. In the grey dawn of European history we find them
          acting as pioneers of art and culture along the shores of the
          Mediterranean, although even then they had been displaced from
          their earliest settlements in the Ægean and the coast of Asia Minor
          by the rising commerce of Greece. Matthew Arnold has drawn a
          brilliant imaginative picture of this collision between the two
          races, and the effect it had on the dauntless and enterprising
          spirit of Phœnicia:—</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page231">[pg

          spirit of masterful and untiring ambition kept up for so many

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the oldest
          Greek literature, however, Tyre is not mentioned, the place which
          she afterwards held being then occupied by Sidon. But after the
          decay of Sidon the rich harvest of her labours fell into the lap of
          Tyre, which thenceforth stands out as the foremost city of
          Phœnicia. She owed her pre-eminence partly to the wisdom and energy
          with which her affairs were administered, but partly also to the
          strength of her natural situation. The city was built both on the
          mainland and on a row of islets about half a mile from the shore.
          This latter portion contained the principal buildings (temples and
          palaces), the open place where business was transacted, and the two
          harbours. It was no doubt from it that the city derived its name
          (צוֹר = Rock); and it always was looked on as the central part of
          Tyre. There was something in the appearance <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page232">[pg 232]</span><a name="Pg232" id="Pg232"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of the island city—the Venice of
          antiquity, rising from mid-ocean with her <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“tiara of proud towers”</span>—which seemed to mark her
          out as destined to be mistress of the sea. It also made a siege of
          Tyre an arduous and a tedious undertaking, as many a conqueror
          found to his cost. Favoured then by these advantages, Tyre speedily
          gathered the traffic of Phœnicia into her own hands, and her wealth
          and luxury were the wonder of the nations. She was known as
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the crowning city, whose merchants were
          princes, and her traffickers the honourable of the earth”</span>
          (Isa. xxiii. 8). She became the great commercial emporium of the
          world. Her colonies were planted all over the islands and coasts of
          the Mediterranean, and the one most frequently mentioned in the
          Bible, Tarshish, was in Spain, beyond Gibraltar. Her seamen had
          ventured beyond the Pillars of Hercules, and undertook distant
          Atlantic voyages to the Canary Islands on the south and the coasts
          of Britain on the north. The most barbarous and inhospitable
          regions were ransacked for the metals and other products needed to
          supply the requirements of civilisation, and everywhere she found a
          market for her own wares and manufactures. The carrying trade of
          the Mediterranean was almost entirely conducted in her ships, while
          her richly laden caravans traversed all the great routes that led
          into the heart of Asia and Africa.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It so happens
          that the twenty-seventh chapter of Ezekiel is one of the best
          sources of information we possess as to the varied and extensive
          commercial relations of Tyre in the sixth century <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=

          will therefore be better to glance shortly at its contents here
          rather than in its proper connection in the development of the
          prophet's thought. It will easily be seen that the description is
          somewhat <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page233">[pg
          233]</span><a name="Pg233" id="Pg233" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          idealised; no details are given of the commodities which Tyre
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">sold</span></em> to the nations—only as an
          afterthought (ver. 33) is it intimated that by sending forth her
          wares she has enriched and satisfied many nations. So the goods
          which she <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">bought</span></em> of them are not represented
          as given in exchange for anything else; Tyre is poetically
          conceived as an empress ruling the peoples by the potent spell of
          her influence, compelling them to drudge for her and bring to her
          feet the gains they have acquired by their heavy labour. Nor can
          the list of nations<a id="noteref_79" name="noteref_79" href=
          "#note_79"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">79</span></span></a> or
          their gifts be meant as exhaustive; it only includes such things as
          served to exhibit the immense variety of useful and costly articles
          which ministered to the wealth and luxury of Tyre. But making
          allowance for this, and for the numerous difficulties which the
          text presents, the passage has evidently been compiled with great
          care; it shows a minuteness of detail and fulness of knowledge
          which could not have been got from books, but displays a lively
          personal interest in the affairs of the world which is surprising
          in a man like Ezekiel.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The order
          followed in the enumeration of nations is not quite clear, but is
          on the whole geographical. Starting from Tarshish in the extreme
          west (ver. 12), the prophet mentions in succession Javan (Ionia),
          Tubal, and Meshech (two tribes to the south-east of the Black Sea),
          and Togarmah (usually identified with Armenia) (vv. 13, 14). These
          represent the northern limit of the Phœnician markets. The
          reference in the next verse (v. 15) is doubtful, on account of a
          difference between the Septuagint and the Hebrew text. If with the
          former we read <span class="tei tei-q">“Rhodes”</span> instead of
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Dedan,”</span> it embraces the nearer
          coasts and islands of the Mediterranean, and this is perhaps on the
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page234">[pg 234]</span><a name=
          "Pg234" id="Pg234" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> whole the more
          natural sense. In this case it is possible that up to this point
          the description has been confined to the sea trade of Phœnicia, if
          we may suppose that the products of Armenia reached Tyre by way of
          the Black Sea. At all events the overland traffic occupies a space
          in the list out of proportion to its actual importance, a fact
          which is easily explained from the prophet's standpoint. First, in
          a line from south to north, we have the nearer neighbours of
          Phœnicia—Edom, Judah, Israel, and Damascus (vv. 16-18). Then the
          remoter tribes and districts of Arabia—Uzal<a id="noteref_80" name=
          "noteref_80" href="#note_80"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">80</span></span></a> (the
          chief city of Yemen), Dedan (on the eastern side of the Gulf of
          Akaba), Arabia and Kedar (nomads of the eastern desert),
          Havilah,<a id="noteref_81" name="noteref_81" href=
          "#note_81"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">81</span></span></a> Sheba,
          and Raamah (in the extreme south of the Arabian peninsula) (vv.
          19-22). Finally the countries tapped by the eastern caravan
          route—Haran (the great trade centre in Mesopotamia), Canneh (?
          Calneh, unknown), Eden (differently spelt from the garden of Eden,
          also unknown), Assyria, and Chilmad (unknown) (ver. 23). These were
          the <span class="tei tei-q">“merchants”</span> and <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“traders”</span> of Tyre, who are represented as
          thronging her market-place with the produce of their respective
          countries.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The imports, so
          far as we can follow the prophet's enumeration, are in nearly all
          cases characteristic products of the regions to which they are
          assigned. Spain is known to have furnished all the metals here
          mentioned—silver, iron, lead, and tin. Greece and Asia Minor were
          centres of the slave traffic (one of the darkest blots on the
          commerce of Phœnicia), and also supplied hardware. Armenia was
          famous as a horse-breeding country, and thence Tyre procured her
          supply of horses and mules. The ebony and tusks of ivory must have
          come from <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page235">[pg
          235]</span><a name="Pg235" id="Pg235" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          Africa; and if the Septuagint is right in reading <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Rhodes”</span> in ver. 15, these articles can only
          have been collected there for shipment to Tyre.<a id="noteref_82"
          name="noteref_82" href="#note_82"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          Through Edom come pearls and precious stones.<a id="noteref_83"

          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">83</span></span></a> Judah
          and Israel furnish Tyre with agricultural and natural produce, as
          they had done from the days of David and Solomon—wheat and oil, wax
          and honey, balm and spices. Damascus yields the famous <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“wine of Helbon”</span>—said to be the only vintage
          that the Persian kings would drink—perhaps also other choice
          wines.<a id="noteref_84" name="noteref_84" href=
          "#note_84"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">84</span></span></a> A rich
          variety of miscellaneous articles, both natural and manufactured,
          is contributed by Arabia,—wrought iron (perhaps sword-blades) from
          Yemen; saddle-cloths from Dedan; sheep and goats from the Bedouin
          tribes; gold, precious stones, and aromatic spices from the
          caravans of Sheba. Lastly, the Mesopotamian countries provide the
          costly textile fabrics from the looms of Babylon so highly prized
          in antiquity—<span class="tei tei-q">“costly garments, mantles of
          blue, purple, and broidered work,”</span> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“many-coloured carpets,”</span> and <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“cords twisted and durable.”</span><a id="noteref_85"
          name="noteref_85" href="#note_85"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This survey of
          the ramifications of Tyrian commerce will have served its purpose
          if it enables us to realise in some measure the conception which
          Ezekiel had formed of the power and prestige of the maritime city,
          whose <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page236">[pg 236]</span><a name=
          "Pg236" id="Pg236" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> destruction he so
          confidently announced. He knew, as did Isaiah before him, how
          deeply Tyre had struck her roots in the life of the old world, how
          indispensable her existence seemed to be to the whole fabric of
          civilisation as then constituted. Both prophets represent the
          nations as lamenting the downfall of the city which had so long
          ministered to their material welfare. The overthrow of Tyre would
          be felt as a world-wide calamity; it could hardly be contemplated
          except as part of a radical subversion of the established order of
          things. This is what Ezekiel has in view, and his attitude towards
          Tyre is governed by his expectation of a great shaking of the
          nations which is to usher in the perfect kingdom of God. In the new
          world to which he looks forward no place will be found for Tyre,
          not even the subordinate position of a handmaid to the people of
          God which Isaiah's vision of the future had assigned to her.
          Beneath all her opulence and refinement the prophet's eye detected
          that which was opposed to the mind of Jehovah—the irreligious
          spirit which is the temptation of a mercantile community,
          manifesting itself in overweening pride and self-exaltation, and in
          sordid devotion to gain as the highest end of a nation's
          existence.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The twenty-sixth
          chapter is in the main a literal prediction of the siege and
          destruction of Tyre by Nebuchadnezzar. It is dated from the year in
          which Jerusalem was captured, and was certainly written after that
          event. The number of the month has accidentally dropped out of the
          text, so that we cannot tell whether at the time of writing the
          prophet had received actual intelligence of the fall of the city.
          At all events it is assumed that the fate of Jerusalem is already
          known in Tyre, and the manner in which the tidings were sure to
          have been received there is the immediate occasion of the prophecy.
          Like many other peoples, Tyre had rejoiced over the <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page237">[pg 237]</span><a name="Pg237" id="Pg237"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> disaster which had befallen the Jewish
          state; but her exultation had a peculiar note of selfish
          calculation, which did not escape the notice of the prophet. Ever
          mindful of her own interest, she sees that a barrier to the free
          development of her commerce has been removed, and she congratulates
          herself on the fortunate turn which events have taken: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Aha! the door of the peoples is broken, it is turned
          towards me; she that was full hath been laid waste!”</span><a id=
          "noteref_86" name="noteref_86" href="#note_86"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">86</span></span></a> (ver.
          2). Although the relations of the two countries had often been
          friendly and sometimes highly advantageous to Tyre, she had
          evidently felt herself hampered by the existence of an independent
          state on the mountain ridge of Palestine. The kingdom of Judah,
          especially in days when it was strong enough to hold Edom in
          subjection, commanded the caravan routes to the Red Sea, and
          doubtless prevented the Phœnician merchants from reaping the full
          profit of their ventures in that direction. It is probable that at
          all times a certain proportion of the revenue of the kings of Judah
          was derived from toll levied on the Tyrian merchandise that passed
          through their territory; and what they thus gained represented so
          much loss to Tyre. It was, to be sure, a small item in the mass of
          business transacted on the exchange of Tyre. But nothing is too
          trivial to enter into the calculations of a community given over to
          the pursuit of gain; and the satisfaction with which the fall of
          Jerusalem was regarded in Tyre showed how completely she was
          debased by her selfish commercial policy, how oblivious she was to
          the spiritual interests bound up with the future of Israel.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Having thus
          exposed the sinful cupidity and insensibility of Tyre, the prophet
          proceeds to describe in general <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page238">[pg 238]</span><a name="Pg238" id="Pg238" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> terms the punishment that is to overtake her.
          Many nations shall be brought up against her, irresistible as the
          sea when it comes up with its waves; her walls and fortifications
          shall be rased; the very dust shall be scraped from her site, so
          that she is left <span class="tei tei-q">“a naked rock”</span>
          rising out of the sea, a place where fishermen spread their nets to
          dry, as in the days before the city was built.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then follows
          (vv. 7-14) a specific announcement of the manner in which judgment
          shall be executed on Tyre. The recent political attitude of the
          city left no doubt as to the quarter from which immediate danger
          was to be apprehended. The Phœnician states had been the most
          powerful members of the confederacy that was formed about 596 to
          throw off the yoke of the Chaldæans, and they were in open revolt
          at the time when Ezekiel wrote. They had apparently thrown in their
          lot with Egypt, and a conflict with Nebuchadnezzar was therefore to
          be expected. Tyre had every reason to avoid a war with a first-rate
          power, which could not fail to be disastrous to her commercial
          interests. But her inhabitants were not destitute of martial
          spirit; they trusted in the strength of their position and their
          command of the sea, and they were in the mood to risk everything
          rather than again renounce their independence and their freedom.
          But all this avails nothing against the purpose which Jehovah has
          purposed concerning Tyre. It is He who brings Nebuchadnezzar, the
          king of kings, from the north with his army and his siege-train,
          and Tyre shall fall before his assault, as Jerusalem has already
          fallen. First of all, the Phœnician cities on the mainland shall be
          ravaged and laid waste, and then operations commence against the
          mother-city herself. The description of the siege and capture of
          the island fortress is given with an abundance of graphic details,
          although, strangely enough, without calling attention to the
          peculiar <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page239">[pg
          239]</span><a name="Pg239" id="Pg239" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          method of attack that was necessary for the reduction of Tyre. The
          great feature of the siege would be the construction of a huge mole
          between the shore and the island; once the wall was reached the
          attack would proceed precisely as in the case of an inland town, in
          the manner depicted on Assyrian monuments. When the breach is made
          in the fortifications the whole army pours into the city, and for
          the first time in her history the walls of Tyre shake with the
          rumbling of chariots in her streets. The conquered city is then
          given up to slaughter and pillage, her songs and her music are
          stilled for ever, her stones and timber and dust are cast into the
          sea, and not a trace remains of the proud mistress of the
          waves.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the third
          strophe (vv. 15-21) the prophet describes the dismay which will be
          caused when the crash of the destruction of Tyre resounds along the
          coasts of the sea. All the <span class="tei tei-q">“princes of the
          sea”</span> (perhaps the rulers of the Phœnician colonies in the
          Mediterranean) are represented as rising from their thrones, and
          putting off their stately raiment, and sitting in the dust
          bewailing the fate of the city. The dirge in which they lift up
          their voices (vv. 17, 18) is given by the Septuagint in a form
          which preserves more nearly than the Hebrew the structure as well
          as the beauty which we should expect in the original:—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But this
          beautiful image is not strong enough to express the prophet's sense
          of the irretrievable ruin that hangs over Tyre. By a bold flight of
          imagination he <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page240">[pg
          240]</span><a name="Pg240" id="Pg240" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          turns from the mourners on earth to follow in thought the descent
          of the city into the under-world (vv. 19-21). The idea that Tyre
          might rise from her ruins after a temporary eclipse and recover her
          old place in the world was one that would readily suggest itself to
          any one who understood the real secret of her greatness. To the
          mind of Ezekiel the impossibility of her restoration lies in the
          fixed purpose of Jehovah, which includes, not only her destruction,
          but her perpetual desolation. <span class="tei tei-q">“When I make
          thee a desolate city, like the cities that are not inhabited; when
          I bring up against thee the deep, and the great waters cover thee;
          then I will bring thee down with them that go down to the pit, with
          the people of old time, and I will make thee dwell in the lowest
          parts of the earth, like the immemorial waste places, with them
          that go down to the pit, that thou be not inhabited nor establish
          thyself in the land of the living.”</span> The whole passage is
          steeped in weird poetic imagery. The <span class=

          suggests something more than the blue waters of the Mediterranean:
          it is the name of the great primeval Ocean, out of which the
          habitable world was fashioned, and which is used as an emblem of
          the irresistible judgments of God.<a id="noteref_88" name=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">88</span></span></a> The
          <span class="tei tei-q">“pit”</span> is the realm of the dead,
          Sheôl, conceived as situated under the earth, where the shades of
          the departed drag out a feeble existence from which there is no
          deliverance. The idea of Sheôl is a frequent subject of poetical
          embellishment in the later books of the Old Testament; and of this
          we have an example here when the prophet represents the once
          populous and thriving city as now a denizen of that dreary place.
          But the essential meaning he wishes to convey is that Tyre is
          numbered among the things that were. She <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“shall be sought, and shall not be found any
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page241">[pg 241]</span><a name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such then is the
          anticipation which Ezekiel in the year 586 had formed of the fate
          of Tyre. No candid reader will suppose that the prophecy is
          anything but what it professes to be—a <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">bonâ-fide</span></span> prediction of the
          total destruction of the city in the immediate future and by the
          hands of Nebuchadnezzar. When Ezekiel wrote, the siege of Tyre had
          not begun; and however clear it may have been to observant men that
          the next stage in the campaign would be the reduction of the
          Phœnician cities, the prophet is at least free from the suspicion
          of having prophesied after the event. The remarkable absence of
          characteristic and special details from the account of the siege is
          the best proof that he is dealing with the future from the true
          prophetic standpoint and clothing a divinely imparted conviction in
          images supplied by a definite historical situation. Nor is there
          any reason to doubt that in some form the prophecy was actually
          published among his fellow-exiles at the date to which it is
          assigned. On these points critical opinion is fairly unanimous. But
          when we come to the question of the fulfilment of the prediction we
          find ourselves in the region of controversy, and, it must be
          admitted, of uncertainty. Some expositors, determined at all
          hazards to vindicate Ezekiel's prophetic authority, maintain that
          Tyre was actually devastated by Nebuchadnezzar in the manner
          described by the prophet, and seek for confirmations of their view
          in the few historical notices we possess of this period of
          Nebuchadnezzar's reign. Others, reading the history differently,
          arrive at the conclusion that Ezekiel's calculations were entirely
          at fault, that Tyre was not captured by the Babylonians at all, and
          that his oracle against Tyre must be reckoned amongst the
          unfulfilled prophecies of the Old Testament. Others <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page242">[pg 242]</span><a name="Pg242" id="Pg242"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> again seek to reconcile an impartial
          historical judgment with a high conception of the function of
          prophecy, and find in the undoubted course of events a real though
          not an exact verification of the words uttered by Ezekiel. It is
          indeed almost by accident that we have any independent
          corroboration of Ezekiel's anticipation with regard to the
          immediate future of Tyre. Oriental discoveries have as yet brought
          to light no important historical monuments of the reign of
          Nebuchadnezzar; and outside of the book of Ezekiel itself we have
          nothing to guide us except the statement of Josephus, based on
          Phœnician and Greek authorities,<a id="noteref_89" name=
          "noteref_89" href="#note_89"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">89</span></span></a> that
          Tyre underwent a thirteen years' siege by the Babylonian conqueror.
          There is no reason whatever to call in question the reliability of
          this important information, although the accompanying statement
          that the siege began in the seventh year of Nebuchadnezzar is
          certainly erroneous. But unfortunately we are not told how the
          siege ended. Whether it was successful or unsuccessful, whether
          Tyre was reduced or capitulated, or was evacuated or beat off her
          assailants, is nowhere indicated. To argue from the silence of the
          historians is impossible; for if one man argues that a catastrophe
          that took place <span class="tei tei-q">“before the eyes of all
          Asia”</span> would not have passed unrecorded in historical books,
          another might urge with equal force that a repulse of
          Nebuchadnezzar was too uncommon an event to be ignored in the
          Phœnician annals.<a id="noteref_90" name="noteref_90" href=
          "#note_90"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">90</span></span></a> On the
          whole the most reasonable hypothesis is perhaps that after the
          thirteen years the city surrendered on not unfavourable terms; but
          this conclusion is based on other considerations than the data or
          the silence of Josephus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The chief reason
          for believing that Nebuchadnezzar was not altogether successful in
          his attack on Tyre is <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page243">[pg
          243]</span><a name="Pg243" id="Pg243" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          found in a supplementary prophecy of Ezekiel's, given in the end of
          the twenty-ninth chapter (vv. 17-21). It was evidently written
          after the siege of Tyre was concluded, and so far as it goes it
          confirms the accuracy of Josephus' sources. It is dated from the
          year 570, sixteen years after the fall of Jerusalem; and it is, in
          fact, the latest oracle in the whole book. The siege of Tyre
          therefore, which had not commenced in 586, when ch. xxvi. was
          written, was finished before 570; and between these terminal dates
          there is just room for the thirteen years of Josephus. The invasion
          of Phœnicia must have been the next great enterprise of the
          Babylonian army in Western Asia after the destruction of Judah, and
          it was only the extraordinary strength of Tyre that enabled it to
          protract the struggle so long. Now what light does Ezekiel throw on
          the issue of the siege? His words are: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, has made his army to
          serve a great service against Tyre; every head made bald and every
          shoulder peeled, yet <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">he and his army got no wages out of
          Tyre</span></em> for the service which he served against
          her.”</span> The prophet then goes on to announce that the spoils
          of Egypt should be the recompense to the army for their unrequited
          labour against Tyre, inasmuch as it was work done for Jehovah. Here
          then, we have evidence first of all that the long siege of Tyre had
          taxed the resources of the besiegers to the utmost. The
          <span class="tei tei-q">“peeled shoulders”</span> and the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“heads made bald”</span> is a graphic
          detail which alludes not obscurely to the monotonous navvy work of
          carrying loads of stones and earth to fill up the narrow channel
          between the mainland and the island,<a id="noteref_91" name=
          "noteref_91" href="#note_91"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">91</span></span></a> so as
          to allow the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page244">[pg
          244]</span><a name="Pg244" id="Pg244" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          engines to be brought up to the walls. Ezekiel was well aware of
          the arduous nature of the undertaking, the expenditure of human
          effort and life which was involved, in the struggle with natural
          obstacles; and his striking conception of these obscure and toiling
          soldiers as unconscious servants of the Almighty shows how
          steadfast was his faith in the word he proclaimed against Tyre. But
          the important point is that they obtained from Tyre no reward—at
          least no adequate reward—for their herculean labours. The
          expression used is no doubt capable of various interpretations. It
          might mean that the siege had to be abandoned, or that the city was
          able to make extremely easy terms of capitulation, or, as Jerome
          suggests, that the Tyrians had carried off their treasures by sea
          and escaped to one of their colonies. In any case it shows that the
          historical event was not in accordance with the details of the
          earlier prophecy. That the wealth of Tyre would fall to the
          conquerors is there assumed as a natural consequence of the capture
          of the city. But whether the city was actually captured or not, the
          victors were somehow disappointed in their expectation of plunder.
          The rich spoil of Tyre, which was the legitimate reward of their
          exhausting toil, had slipped from their eager grasp; to this extent
          at least the reality fell short of the prediction, and
          Nebuchadnezzar had to be compensated for his losses at Tyre by the
          promise of an easy conquest of Egypt.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But if this had
          been all it is not probable that Ezekiel would have deemed it
          necessary to supplement his earlier prediction in the way we have
          seen after an interval of sixteen years. The mere circumstance that
          the sack of Tyre had failed to yield the booty that the besiegers
          counted on was not of a nature to attract attention amongst the
          prophet's auditors, or to throw doubt on the genuineness of his
          inspiration. And we know that there was a much <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page245">[pg 245]</span><a name="Pg245" id="Pg245"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> more serious difference between the
          prophecy and the event than this. It is from what has just been
          said extremely doubtful whether Nebuchadnezzar actually destroyed
          Tyre, but even if he did she very quickly recovered much of her
          former prosperity and glory. That her commerce was seriously
          crippled during the struggle with Babylonia we may well believe,
          and it is possible that she never again was what she had been
          before this humiliation came upon her. But for all that the
          enterprise and prosperity of Tyre continued for many ages to excite
          the admiration of the most enlightened nations of antiquity. The
          destruction of the city, therefore, if it took place, had not the
          finality which Ezekiel had anticipated. Not till after the lapse of
          eighteen centuries could it be said with approximate truth that she
          was like <span class="tei tei-q">“a bare rock in the midst of the
          sea.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The most
          instructive fact for us, however, is that Ezekiel reissued his
          original prophecy, knowing that it had not been literally
          fulfilled. In the minds of his hearers the apparent falsification
          of his predictions had revived old prejudices against him which
          interfered with the prosecution of his work. They reasoned that a
          prophecy so much out of joint with the reality was sufficient to
          discredit his claim to be an authoritative exponent of the mind of
          Jehovah; and so the prophet found himself embarrassed by a
          recurrence of the old unbelieving attitude which had hindered his
          public activity before the destruction of Jerusalem. He has not for
          the present <span class="tei tei-q">“an open mouth”</span> amongst
          them, and he feels that his words will not be fully received until
          they are verified by the restoration of Israel to its own land. But
          it is evident that he himself did not share the view of his
          audience, otherwise he would certainly have suppressed a prophecy
          which lacked the mark of authenticity. On the contrary he published
          it for the perusal of a wider circle of readers, in <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page246">[pg 246]</span><a name="Pg246" id="Pg246"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the conviction that what he had spoken
          was a true word of God, and that its essential truth did not depend
          on its exact correspondence with the facts of history. In other
          words, he believed in it as a true reading of the principles
          revealed in God's moral government of the world—a reading which had
          received a partial verification in the blow which had been dealt at
          the pride of Tyre, and which would receive a still more signal
          fulfilment in the final convulsions which were to introduce the day
          of Israel's restoration and glory. Only we must remember that the
          prophet's horizon was necessarily limited; and as he did not
          contemplate the slow development and extension of the kingdom of
          God through long ages, so he could not have taken into account the
          secular operation of historic causes which eventually brought about
          the ruin of Tyre.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The remaining
          oracles on Tyre (chs. xxvii., xxviii. 1-19) are somewhat different
          both in subject and mode of treatment from the chapter we have just
          finished. Ch. xxvi. is in the main a direct announcement of the
          fall of Tyre, delivered in the oratorical style which is the usual
          vehicle of prophetic address. She is regarded as a state occupying
          a definite place among the other states of the world, and sharing
          the fate of other peoples who by their conduct towards Israel or
          their ungodliness and arrogance have incurred the anger of Jehovah.
          The two great odes which follow are purely ideal delineations of
          what Tyre is in herself; her destruction is assumed as certain
          rather than directly predicted, and the prophet gives free play to
          his imagination in the effort to set forth the conception of the
          city which was impressed on his mind. In ch. xxvii. he dwells on
          the external greatness and magnificence of Tyre, her architectural
          splendour, her political and military power, and above all her
          amazing commercial enterprise. Ch. xxviii., on the other hand, is a
          meditation on the peculiar genius of Tyre, her inner spirit of
          pride and self-sufficiency, as embodied in the person of her king.
          From a literary point of view the two chapters are amongst the most
          beautiful in the whole book. In the twenty-seventh chapter the
          fiery indignation of the prophet almost disappears, giving place to
          the play of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page248">[pg
          248]</span><a name="Pg248" id="Pg248" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          poetic fancy, and a flow of lyric emotion more perfectly rendered
          than in any other part of Ezekiel's writings. The distinctive
          feature of each passage is the elegy pronounced over the fall of
          Tyre; and although the elegy seems just on the point of passing
          into the taunt-song, yet the accent of triumph is never suffered to
          overwhelm the note of sadness to which these poems owe their
          special charm.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Ch. xxvii. is
            described as a dirge over Tyre. In the previous chapter the
            nations were represented as bewailing her fall, but here the
            prophet himself takes up a lamentation for her; and, as may have
            been usual in real funereal dirges, he commences by celebrating
            the might and riches of the doomed city. The fine image which is
            maintained throughout the chapter was probably suggested to
            Ezekiel by the picturesque situation of Tyre on her sea-girt rock
            at <span class="tei tei-q">“the entries of the sea.”</span> He
            compares her to a stately vessel riding at anchor<a id=

            water, tight and seaworthy and sumptuously furnished; and the
            prophet's eye runs rapidly over the chief points of her elaborate
            construction and equipment (vv. 3-11). Her timbers are fashioned

            variety of cedar) inlaid with ivory imported from Cyprus. Her
            canvas fittings are still more exquisite and costly. The sail is
            of Egyptian byssus with embroidered work, and the awning over the
            deck was of cloth resplendent in the two purple dyes procured
            from the coasts of Elishah.<a id="noteref_95" name="noteref_95"

            ship is fitted up for pleasure and luxury as well as for traffic,
            the fact symbolised being obviously the architectural and other
            splendours which justified the city's boast that she was
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the perfection of beauty.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But Tyre was
            wise and powerful as well as beautiful; and so the prophet, still
            keeping up the metaphor, proceeds to describe how the great ship
            is manned. Her steersmen are the experienced statesmen whom she
            herself has bred and raised to power; her rowers are the men of
            Sidon and Aradus, who spend their strength in her service. The
            elders and wise men of Gebal are her shipwrights (literally
            <span class="tei tei-q">“stoppers of leaks”</span>); and so great
            is her influence that all the naval resources of the world are
            subject to her control. Besides this Tyre employs an army of
            mercenaries drawn from the remotest quarters of the earth—from
            Persia and North Africa, as well as the subordinate towns of
            Phœnicia; and these, represented as hanging their shields and
            helmets on her sides, make her beauty complete.<a id="noteref_96"
            name="noteref_96" href="#note_96"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">96</span></span></a> In
            these verses the prophet pays a tribute of admiration to the
            astuteness with which the rulers of Tyre used their resources to
            strengthen her position as the head of the Phœnician confederacy.
            Three <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page250">[pg
            250]</span><a name="Pg250" id="Pg250" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            of the cities mentioned—Sidon, Aradus, and Gebal or Byblus—were
            the most important in Phœnicia; two of them at least had a longer
            history than herself, yet they are here truly represented as
            performing the rough menial labour which brought wealth and
            renown to Tyre. It required no ordinary statecraft to preserve
            the balance of so many complex and conflicting interests, and
            make them all co-operate for the advancement of the glory of
            Tyre; but hitherto her <span class="tei tei-q">“wise men”</span>
            had proved equal to the task.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The second
            strophe (vv. 12-25) contains the survey of Tyrian commerce, which
            has already been analysed in another connection.<a id=
            "noteref_97" name="noteref_97" href="#note_97"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">97</span></span></a> At
            first sight it appears as if the allegory were here abandoned,
            and the impression is partly correct. In reality the city,
            although personified, is regarded as the emporium of the world's
            commerce, to which all the nations stream with their produce. But
            at the end it appears that the various commodities enumerated
            represent the cargo with which the ship is laden. Ships of
            Tarshish—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the largest class of
            merchant vessels then afloat, used for the long Atlantic
            voyage—wait upon her, and fill her with all sorts of precious
            things (ver. 25). Then in the last strophe (vv. 26-36), which
            speaks of the destruction of Tyre, the figure of the ship is
            boldly resumed. The heavily freighted vessel is rowed into the
            open sea; there she is struck by an east wind and founders in
            deep water. The image suggests two ideas, which must not be
            pressed, although they may <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page251">[pg 251]</span><a name="Pg251" id="Pg251" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> have an element of historic truth in them:
            one is that Tyre perished under the weight of her own commercial
            greatness, and the other that her ruin was hastened through the
            folly of her rulers. But the main idea is that the destruction of
            the city was wrought by the power of God, which suddenly
            overwhelmed her at the height of her prosperity and activity. As
            the waves close over the doomed vessel the cry of anguish that
            goes up from the drowning mariners and passengers strikes terror
            into the hearts of all seafaring men. They forsake their ships,
            and having reached the safety of the shore abandon themselves to
            frantic demonstrations of grief, joining their voices in a
            lamentation over the fate of the goodly ship which symbolised the
            mistress of the sea (vv. 32-36)<a id="noteref_98" name=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Ch. xxviii.
            1-19.—Here the prophet turns to the prince of Tyre, who is
            addressed throughout as the impersonation of the consciousness of
            a great commercial community. We happen to know from Josephus
            that the name of the reigning king at this time was Ithobaal or
            Ethbaal II. But it is manifest that the terms of Ezekiel's
            message have no reference to the individuality of this or any
            other prince of Tyre. It is not likely that the king could have
            exercised any great political influence in a city <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“whose merchants were all princes”</span>; indeed, we
            learn from Josephus that the monarchy was abolished in favour of
            some sort of elective constitution not long after the death of
            Ithobaal. Nor is there any reason to suppose that Ezekiel has in
            view any special manifestation of arrogance on the part of the
            royal house, such as a pretension to be descended from the gods.
            The king here is simply the representative of the genius of the
            community, the sins of heart charged against him are the
            expression of the sinful principle which the prophet detected
            beneath the refinement and luxury of Tyre, and his shameful death
            only symbolises the downfall of the city. The prophecy consists
            of two parts: first, an accusation against the prince of Tyre,
            ending with a threat of destruction (vv. 2-10); and second, a
            lament over his fall (vv. 11-19). The point of view is very
            different in these two sections. In the first the prince is still
            conceived as a man; and the language put into his mouth, although
            extravagant, does not exceed the limits of purely human
            arrogance. In the second, however, the king appears as an angelic
            being, an inhabitant <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page253">[pg
            253]</span><a name="Pg253" id="Pg253" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            of Eden and a companion of the cherub, sinless at first, and
            falling from his high estate through his own transgression. It
            almost seems as if the prophet had in his mind the idea of a
            tutelary spirit or genius of Tyre, like the angelic princes in
            the book of Daniel who preside over the destinies of different
            nations.<a id="noteref_99" name="noteref_99" href=
            "#note_99"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">99</span></span></a> But
            in spite of its enhanced idealism, the passage only clothes in
            forms drawn from Babylonian mythology the boundless
            self-glorification of Tyre; and the expulsion of the prince from
            paradise is merely the ideal counterpart of the overthrow of the
            city which is his earthly abode.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sin of
            Tyre is an overweening pride, which culminated in an attitude of
            self-deification on the part of its king. Surrounded on every
            hand by the evidences of man's mastery over the world, by the
            achievements of human art and industry and enterprise, the king
            feels as if his throne on the sea-girt island were a veritable
            seat of the gods, and as if he himself were a being truly divine.
            His heart is lifted up; and, forgetful of the limits of his
            mortality, he <span class="tei tei-q">“sets his mind like the
            mind of a god.”</span> The godlike quality on which he specially
            prides himself is the superhuman wisdom evinced by the
            extraordinary prosperity of the city with which he identifies
            himself. Wiser than Daniel! the prophet ironically exclaims;
            <span class="tei tei-q">“no secret thing is too dark for
            thee!”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“By thy wisdom and thine
            insight thou hast gotten thee wealth, and hast gathered gold and
            silver into thy treasuries: by thy great wisdom in thy commerce
            thou hast multiplied thy wealth, and thy heart is lifted up
            because of thy riches.”</span> The prince sees in the vast
            accumulation of material resources in Tyre nothing but the
            reflection of the genius of her inhabitants; and being himself
            the incarnation of the spirit of the city, he takes the glory of
            it to himself <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page254">[pg
            254]</span><a name="Pg254" id="Pg254" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            and esteems himself a god. Such impious self-exaltation must
            inevitably call down the vengeance of Him who is the only living
            God; and Ezekiel proceeds to announce the humiliation of the
            prince by the <span class="tei tei-q">“most ruthless of the
            nations”</span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the Chaldæans. He shall
            then know how much of divinity doth hedge a king. In face of them
            that seek his life he shall learn that he is man and not God, and
            that there are forces in the world against which the vaunted
            wisdom of Tyre is of no avail. An ignominious death<a id=
            "noteref_100" name="noteref_100" href="#note_100"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">100</span></span></a> at
            the hand of strangers is the fate reserved for the mortal who so
            proudly exalted himself against all that is called God.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The thought
            thus expressed, when disengaged from its peculiar setting, is one
            of permanent importance. To Ezekiel, as to the prophets
            generally, Tyre is the representative of commercial greatness,
            and the truth which he here seeks to illustrate is that the
            abnormal development of the mercantile spirit had in her case
            destroyed the capacity of faith in that which is truly divine.
            Tyre no doubt, like every other ancient state, still maintained a
            public religion of the type common to Semitic paganism. She was
            the sacred seat of a special cult, and the temple of Melkarth was
            considered the chief glory of the city. But the public and
            perfunctory worship which was there celebrated had long ceased to
            express the highest consciousness of the community. The real god
            of Tyre was not Baal nor Melkarth, but the king, or any other
            object that might serve as a symbol of her civic greatness. Her
            religion was one that embodied itself in no outward ritual; it
            was the enthusiasm which was kindled in the heart of every
            citizen of Tyre by the magnificence of the imperial city to which
            he belonged. The state of mind <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page255">[pg 255]</span><a name="Pg255" id="Pg255" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> which Ezekiel regards as characteristic of
            Tyre was perhaps the inevitable outcome of a high civilisation
            informed by no loftier religious conceptions than those common to
            heathenism. It is the idea which afterwards found expression in
            the deification of the Roman emperors—the idea that the state is
            the only power higher than the individual to which he can look
            for the furtherance of his material and spiritual interests, the
            only power, therefore, which rightly claims his homage and his
            reverence. None the less it is a state of mind which is
            destructive of all that is essential to living religion; and Tyre
            in her proud self-sufficiency was perhaps further from a true
            knowledge of God than the barbarous tribes who in all sincerity
            worshipped the rude idols which represented the invisible power
            that ruled their destinies. And in exposing the irreligious
            spirit which lay at the heart of the Tyrian civilisation the
            prophet lays his finger on the spiritual danger which attends the
            successful pursuit of the finite interests of human life. The
            thought of God, the sense of an immediate relation of the spirit
            of man to the Eternal and the Infinite, are easily displaced from
            men's minds by undue admiration for the achievements of a culture
            based on material progress, and supplying every need of human
            nature except the very deepest, the need of God. <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“For that is truly a man's religion, the object of
            which fills and holds captive his soul and heart and mind, in

            for and hopes for.”</span><a id="noteref_101" name="noteref_101"

            commercial spirit is indeed but one of the forms in which men
            devote themselves to the service of this present world; but in
            any community where it reigns supreme we may confidently look for
            the same signs of religious decay which Ezekiel detected in Tyre
            in his own day. At all events <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

            accumulation of the means of living, and whose social problems
            all run up into the great question of the distribution of wealth.
            It is essentially the same truth which Ruskin, with something of
            the power and insight of a Hebrew prophet, has so eloquently
            enforced on the men who make modern England—that the true
            religion of a community does not live in the venerable
            institutions to which it yields a formal and conventional
            deference, but in the objects which inspire its most eager
            ambitions, the ideals which govern its standard of worth, in
            those things wherein it finds the ultimate ground of its
            confidence and the reward of its work.<a id="noteref_102" name=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
            lamentation over the fall of the prince of Tyre (vv. 11-19)
            reiterates the same lesson with a boldness and freedom of
            imagination not usual with this prophet. The <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page257">[pg 257]</span><a name="Pg257" id=
            "Pg257" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> passage is full of
            obscurities and difficulties which cannot be adequately discussed
            here, but the main lines of the conception are easily grasped. It
            describes the original state of the prince as a semi-divine
            being, and his fall from that state on account of sin that was
            found in him. The picture is no doubt ironical; Ezekiel actually
            means nothing more than that the soaring pride of Tyre enthroned
            its king or its presiding genius in the seat of the gods, and
            endowed him with attributes more than mortal. The prophet accepts
            the idea, and shows that there was sin in Tyre enough to hurl the
            most radiant of celestial creatures from heaven to hell. The
            passage presents certain obvious affinities with the account of
            the Fall in the second and third chapters of Genesis; but it also
            contains reminiscences of a mythology the key to which is now
            lost. It can hardly be supposed that the vivid details of the
            imagery, such as the <span class="tei tei-q">“mountain of
            God,”</span> the <span class="tei tei-q">“stones of fire,”</span>
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the precious gems,”</span> are
            altogether due to the prophet's imagination. The mountain of the
            gods is now known to have been a prominent idea of the Babylonian
            religion; and there appears to have been a widespread notion that
            in the abode of the gods were treasures of gold and precious
            stones, jealously guarded by griffins, of which small quantities
            found their way into the possession of men. It is possible that
            fragments of these mythical notions may have reached the
            knowledge of Ezekiel during his sojourn in Babylon and been used
            by him to fill up his picture of the glories which surrounded the
            first estate of the king of Tyre. It should be observed, however,
            that the prince is not to be identified with the cherub or one of
            the cherubim. The words <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou art the
            anointed cherub that covereth, and I have set thee so”</span>
            (ver. 14) may be translated <span class="tei tei-q">“With the ...
            cherub I set thee”</span>; and similarly the words of ver. 16,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“I will destroy thee, O covering
            cherub,”</span> should probably <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page258">[pg 258]</span><a name="Pg258" id="Pg258" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> be rendered <span class="tei tei-q">“And
            the cherub hath destroyed thee.”</span> The whole conception is
            greatly simplified by these changes, and the principal features
            of it, so far as they can be made out with clearness, are as
            follows: The cherub is the warden of the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“holy mountain of God,”</span> and no doubt also (as
            in ch. i.) the symbol and bearer of the divine glory. When it is
            said that the prince of Tyre was placed with the cherub, the
            meaning is that he had his place in the abode of God, or was
            admitted to the presence of God, so long as he preserved the
            perfection in which he was created (ver. 15). The other allusions
            to his original glory, such as the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“covering”</span> of precious stones and the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“walking amidst fiery stones,”</span>
            cannot be explained with any degree of certainty.<a id=
            "noteref_103" name="noteref_103" href="#note_103"><span class=

            When iniquity is found in him so that he must be banished from
            the presence of God, the cherub is said to destroy him from the
            midst of the stones of fire—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, is the agent of the
            divine judgment which descends on the prince. It is thus doubtful
            whether the prince is conceived as a perfect human being, like
            Adam before his fall, or as an angelic, superhuman creature; but
            the point is of little importance in an ideal delineation such as
            we have here. It will be seen that even on the first supposition
            there is no very close correspondence with the story of Eden in
            the book of Genesis, for there the cherubim are placed to guard
            the way of the tree of life only after man has been expelled from
            the garden.</p>

            lifted up because of his beauty, and he forfeited his godlike
            wisdom over his brilliance (ver. 17). But really, this change
            passing over the spirit of the prince in the seat of God is only
            the reflection of what is done on earth in Tyre. As her commerce
            increased, the proofs of her unjust and unscrupulous use of
            wealth were accumulated against her, and her midst was filled
            with violence (ver. 16). This is the only allusion in the three
            chapters to the wrong and oppression and the outrages on humanity
            which were the inevitable accompaniments of that greed of gain
            which had taken possession of the Tyrian community. And these
            sins are regarded as a demoralisation taking place in the nature
            of the prince who is the representative of the city; by the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“iniquity of his traffic he has profaned
            his holiness,”</span> and is cast down from his lofty seat to the
            earth, a spectacle of abject humiliation for kings to gloat over.
            By a sudden change of metaphor the destruction of the city is
            also represented as a fire breaking out in the vitals of the
            prince and reducing his body to ashes—a conception which has not
            unnaturally suggested to some commentators the fable of the
            phœnix which was supposed periodically to immolate herself in a
            fire of her own kindling.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A short oracle
            on Sidon completes the series of prophecies dealing with the
            future of Israel's immediate neighbours (vv. 20-23). Sidon lay
            about twenty miles farther north than Tyre, and was, as we have
            seen, at this <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page260">[pg
            260]</span><a name="Pg260" id="Pg260" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            time subject to the authority of the younger and more vigorous
            city. From the book of Jeremiah,<a id="noteref_104" name=
            "noteref_104" href="#note_104"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">104</span></span></a>
            however, we see that Sidon was an autonomous state, and preserved
            a measure of independence even in matters of foreign policy.
            There is therefore nothing arbitrary in assigning a separate
            oracle to this most northerly of the states in immediate contact
            with the people of Israel, although it must be admitted that
            Ezekiel has nothing distinctive to say of Sidon. Phœnicia was in
            truth so overshadowed by Tyre that all the characteristics of the
            people have been amply illustrated in the chapters that have
            dealt with the latter city. The prophecy is accordingly delivered
            in the most general terms, and indicates rather the purpose and
            effect of the judgment than the manner in which it is to come or
            the character of the people against whom it is directed. It
            passes insensibly into a prediction of the glorious future of
            Israel, which is important as revealing the underlying motive of
            all the preceding utterances against the heathen nations. The
            restoration of Israel and the destruction of her old neighbours
            are both parts of one comprehensive scheme of divine providence,
            the ultimate object of which is a demonstration before the eyes
            of the world of the holiness of Jehovah. That men might know that
            He is Jehovah, God alone, is the end alike of His dealings with
            the heathen and with His own people. And the two parts of God's
            plan are in the mind of Ezekiel intimately related to each other;
            the one is merely a condition of the realisation of the other.
            The crowning proof of Jehovah's holiness will be seen in His
            faithfulness to the promise made to the patriarchs of the
            possession of the land of Canaan, and in the security and
            prosperity enjoyed by Israel when brought back to their land a
            purified nation. Now in the past <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page261">[pg 261]</span><a name="Pg261" id="Pg261" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> Israel had been constantly interfered with,
            crippled, humiliated, and seduced by the petty heathen powers
            around her borders. These had been a pricking brier and a
            stinging thorn (ver. 24), constantly annoying and harassing her
            and impeding the free development of her national life. Hence the
            judgments here denounced against them are no doubt in the first
            instance a punishment for what they had been and done in the
            past; but they are also a clearing of the stage that Israel might
            be isolated from the rest of the world, and be free to mould her
            national life and her religious institutions in accordance with
            the will of her God. That is the substance of the last three
            verses of the chapter; and while they exhibit the peculiar
            limitations of the prophet's thinking, they enable us at the same
            time to do justice to the singular unity and consistency of aim
            which guided him in his great forecast of the future of the
            kingdom of God. There remains now the case of Egypt to be dealt
            with; but Egypt's relations to Israel and her position in the
            world were so unique that Ezekiel reserves consideration of her
            future for a separate group of oracles longer than those on all
            the other nations put together.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Egypt figures in
          the prophecies of Ezekiel as a great world-power cherishing
          projects of universal dominion. Once more, as in the age of Isaiah,
          the ruling factor in Asiatic politics was the duel for the mastery
          of the world between the rival empires of the Nile and the
          Euphrates. The influence of Egypt was perhaps even greater in the
          beginning of the sixth century than it had been in the end of the
          eighth, although in the interval it had suffered a signal eclipse.
          Isaiah (ch. xix.) had predicted a subjugation of Egypt by the
          Assyrians, and this prophecy had been fulfilled in the year 672,
          when Esarhaddon invaded the country and incorporated it in the
          Assyrian empire. He divided its territory into twenty petty
          principalities governed by Assyrian or native rulers, and this
          state of things had lasted with little change for a generation.
          During the reign of Asshurbanipal Egypt was frequently overrun by
          Assyrian armies, and the repeated attempts of the Ethiopian
          monarchs, aided by revolts among the native princes, to reassert
          their sovereignty over the Nile Valley were all foiled by the
          energy of the Assyrian king or the vigilance of his generals. At
          last, however, a new era of prosperity dawned for Egypt about the
          year 645. Psammetichus, the ruler of Saïs, with the help of foreign
          mercenaries, succeeded in uniting the whole land under his sway; he
          expelled the Assyrian <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page263">[pg
          263]</span><a name="Pg263" id="Pg263" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          garrison, and became the founder of the brilliant twenty-sixth
          (Saïte) dynasty. From this time Egypt possessed in a strong central
          administration the one indispensable condition of her material
          prosperity. Her power was consolidated by a succession of vigorous
          rulers, and she immediately began to play a leading part in the
          affairs of Asia. The most distinguished king of the dynasty was
          Necho II., the son and successor of Psammetichus. Two striking
          facts mentioned by Herodotus are worthy of mention, as showing the
          originality and vigour with which the Egyptian administration was
          at this time conducted. One is the project of cutting a canal
          between the Nile and the Red Sea, an undertaking which was
          abandoned by Necho in consequence of an oracle warning him that he
          was only working for the advantage of foreigners—meaning no doubt
          the Phœnicians. Necho, however, knew how to turn the Phœnician
          seamanship to good account, as is proved by the other great stroke
          of genius with which he is credited—the circumnavigation of Africa.
          It was a Phœnician fleet, despatched from Suez by his orders, which
          first rounded the Cape of Good Hope, returning to Egypt by the
          Straits of Gibraltar after a three years' voyage. And if Necho was
          less successful in war than in the arts of peace, it was not from
          want of activity. He was the Pharaoh who defeated Josiah in the
          plain of Megiddo, and afterwards contested the lordship of Syria
          with Nebuchadnezzar. His defeat at Carchemish in 604 compelled him
          to retire to his own land; but the power of Egypt was still
          unbroken, and the Chaldæan king knew that he would yet have to
          reckon with her in his schemes for the conquest of Palestine.</p>

          which these prophecies belong the king of Egypt was Pharaoh Hophra

          of Syria. He is said to have attacked Phœnicia by sea and land,
          capturing Sidon and defeating a Tyrian fleet in a naval engagement.
          His object must have been to secure the ascendency of the Egyptian
          party in the Phœnician cities; and the stubborn resistance which
          Nebuchadnezzar encountered from Tyre was no doubt the result of the
          political arrangements made by Hophra after his victory. No armed
          intervention was needed to ensure a spirited defence of Jerusalem;
          and it was only after the Babylonians were encamped around the city
          that Hophra sent an Egyptian army to its relief. He was unable,
          however, to effect more than a temporary suspension of the siege,
          and returned to Egypt, leaving Judah to its fate, apparently
          without venturing on a battle (Jer. xxxvii. 5-7). No further
          hostilities between Egypt and Babylon are recorded during the
          lifetime of Hophra. He continued to reign with vigour and success
          till 571, when he was dethroned by Amasis, one of his own
          generals.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These
          circumstances show a remarkable parallel to the political situation
          with which Isaiah had to deal at the time of Sennacherib's
          invasion. Judah was again in the position of the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“earthen pipkin between two iron pots.”</span> It is
          certain that neither Jehoiakim nor Zedekiah, any more than the
          advisers of Hezekiah in the earlier period, would have embarked on
          a conflict with the Mesopotamian empire but for delusive promises
          of Egyptian support. There was the same vacillation and division of
          counsels in Jerusalem, the same dilatoriness on the part of Egypt,
          and the same futile effort to retrieve a desperate situation after
          the favourable moment had been allowed to slip. In both cases the
          conflict was precipitated by the triumph of an Egyptian party in
          the Judæan court; and it is probable that in both cases the king
          was coerced into a policy of which his judgment did not approve.
          And the prophets <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page265">[pg
          265]</span><a name="Pg265" id="Pg265" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          of the later period, Jeremiah and Ezekiel, adhere closely to the
          lines laid down by Isaiah in the time of Sennacherib, warning the
          people against putting their trust in the vain help of Egypt, and
          counselling passive submission to the course of events which
          expressed the unalterable judgment of the Almighty. Ezekiel indeed
          borrows an image that had been current in the days of Isaiah in
          order to set forth the utter untrustworthiness and dishonesty of
          Egypt towards the nations who were induced to rely on her power. He
          compares her to a staff of reed, which breaks when one grasps it,
          piercing the hand and making the loins to totter when it is leant
          upon.<a id="noteref_105" name="noteref_105" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">105</span></span></a> Such
          had Egypt been to Israel through all her history, and such she will
          again prove herself to be in her last attempt to use Israel as the
          tool of her selfish designs. The great difference between Ezekiel
          and Isaiah is that, whereas Isaiah had access to the councils of
          Hezekiah and could bring his influence to bear on the inception of
          schemes of state, not without hope of averting what he saw to be a
          disastrous decision, Ezekiel could only watch the development of
          events from afar, and throw his warnings into the form of
          predictions of the fate in store for Egypt.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The oracles
          against Egypt are seven in number: (i) ch. xxix. 1-16; (ii) 17-21;
          (iii) xxx. 1-19; (iv) 20-26; (v) xxxi.; (vi) xxxii. 1-16; (vii)
          17-32. They are all variations of one theme, the annihilation of
          the power of Egypt by Nebuchadnezzar, and little progress of
          thought can be traced from the first to the last. Excluding the
          supplementary prophecy of ch. xxix. 17-21, which is a later
          addition, the order appears to be strictly chronological.<a id=

          far the dates refer to actual occurrences coming to the knowledge
          of the prophet it is impossible for us to say. It is clear that his
          interest is centred on the fate of Jerusalem then hanging in the
          balance; and it is possible that the first oracles (chs. xxix.
          1-16, xxx. 1-19) may be called forth by the appearance of Hophra's
          army on the scene, while the next (ch. xxx. 20-26) plainly alludes
          to the repulse of the Egyptians by the Chaldæans. But no attempt
          can be made to connect the prophecies with incidents of the
          campaign; the prophet's thoughts are wholly occupied with the moral
          and religious issues involved in the contest, the vindication of
          Jehovah's holiness in the overthrow of the great world-power which
          sought to thwart His purposes.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Ch. xxix. 1-16
          is an introduction to all that follows, presenting a general
          outline of the prophet's conceptions of the fate of Egypt. It
          describes the sin of which she has been guilty, and indicates the
          nature of the judgment that is to overtake her and her future place
          among the nations of the world. The Pharaoh is compared to a
          <span class="tei tei-q">“great dragon,”</span> wallowing in his
          native waters, and deeming himself secure from molestation in his
          reedy haunts. The crocodile was a natural symbol of Egypt, and the
          image conveys accurately the impression of sluggish and unwieldy
          strength which Egypt in the days of Ezekiel had long produced on
          shrewd observers of her policy. Pharaoh is the incarnate genius of
          the country; and as <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page267">[pg
          267]</span><a name="Pg267" id="Pg267" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          the Nile was the strength and glory of Egypt, he is here
          represented as arrogating to himself the ownership and even the
          creation of the wonderful river. <span class="tei tei-q">“My river
          is mine, and I have made it”</span> is the proud and blasphemous
          thought which expresses his consciousness of a power that owns no
          superior in earth or heaven. That the Nile was worshipped by the
          Egyptians with divine honours did not alter the fact that beneath
          all their ostentatious religious observances there was an immoral
          sense of irresponsible power in the use of the natural resources to
          which the land owed its prosperity. For this spirit of ungodly
          self-exaltation the king and people of Egypt are to be visited with
          a signal judgment, from which they shall learn who it is that is
          God over all. The monster of the Nile shall be drawn from his
          waters with hooks, with all his fishes sticking to his scales, and
          left to perish ignominiously on the desert sands. The rest of the
          prophecy (vv. 8-16) gives the explanation of the allegory in
          literal, though still general, terms. The meaning is that Egypt
          shall be laid waste by the sword, its teeming population led into
          captivity, and the land shall lie desolate, untrodden by the foot
          of man or beast for the space of forty years. <span class=

          extreme limits of the country—the rich valley of the Nile shall be
          uncultivated and uninhabited for that period of time.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The most
          interesting feature of the prophecy is the view which is given of
          the final condition of the Egyptian empire (vv. 13-16). In all
          cases the prophetic delineations of the future of different nations
          are coloured by the present circumstances of those nations as known
          to the writers. Ezekiel knew that the fertile soil of Egypt
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page268">[pg 268]</span><a name=
          "Pg268" id="Pg268" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> would always be
          capable of supporting an industrious peasantry, and that her
          existence did not depend on her continuing to play the <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">rôle</span></span> of a great power. Tyre
          depended on her commerce, and apart from that which was the root of
          her sin could never be anything but the resort of poor fishermen,
          who would not even make their dwelling on the barren rock in the
          midst of the sea. But Egypt could still be a country, though shorn
          of the glory and power which had made her a snare to the people of
          God. On the other hand the geographical isolation of the land made
          it impossible that she should lose her individuality amongst the
          nations of the world. Unlike the small states, such as Edom and
          Ammon, which were obviously doomed to be swallowed up by the
          surrounding population as soon as their power was broken, Egypt
          would retain her distinct and characteristic life as long as the
          physical condition of the world remained what it was. Accordingly
          the prophet does not contemplate an utter annihilation of Egypt,
          but only a temporary chastisement succeeded by her permanent
          degradation to the lowest rank among the kingdoms. The forty years
          of her desolation represent in round numbers the period of Chaldæan
          supremacy during which Jerusalem lies in ruins. Ezekiel at this
          time expected the invasion of Egypt to follow soon after the
          capture of Jerusalem, so that the restoration of the two peoples
          would be simultaneous. At the end of forty years the whole world
          will be reorganised on a new basis, Israel occupying the central
          position as the people of God, and in that new world Egypt shall
          have a separate but subordinate place. Jehovah will bring back the
          Egyptians from their captivity, and cause them to return to
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Pathros,<a id="noteref_109" name=
          "noteref_109" href="#note_109"><span class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">109</span></span></a> the
          land of their origin,”</span> and there make them a <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“lowly state,”</span> no longer an imperial power, but
          humbler than the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page269">[pg
          269]</span><a name="Pg269" id="Pg269" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          surrounding kingdoms. The righteousness of Jehovah and the interest
          of Israel alike demand that Egypt should be thus reduced from her
          former greatness. In the old days her vast and imposing power had
          been a constant temptation to the Israelites, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“a confidence, a reminder of iniquity,”</span> leading
          them to put their trust in human power and luring them into paths
          of danger by deceitful promises (vv. 6-7). In the final
          dispensation of history this shall no longer be the case: Israel
          shall then know Jehovah, and no form of human power shall be
          suffered to lead their hearts astray from Him who is the rock of
          their salvation.</p>

          neighbouring nations. It signalises the advent of the great day of

          everywhere. It is the <span class="tei tei-q">“time of the
          heathen”</span> that has come (ver. 3). Egypt being the chief
          embodiment of secular power on the basis of pagan religion, the
          sudden collapse of her might is equivalent to a judgment on
          heathenism in general, and the moral effect of it conveys to the
          world a demonstration of the omnipotence of the one true God whom
          she had ignored and defied. The nations immediately involved in the
          fall of Egypt are the allies and mercenaries whom she has called to

          motley army, fall by the sword along with her, and their countries
          share the desolation that overtakes the land of Egypt. Swift
          messengers are then seen speeding up the Nile in ships to convey to
          the careless Ethiopians the alarming tidings of the overthrow of
          Egypt (ver. 9). From this point the prophet confines his attention
          to the fate of Egypt, which he describes with a fulness of detail
          that implies a certain acquaintance both with the topography and
          the social circumstances of the country. In ver. 10 Nebuchadnezzar
          and the Chaldæans are for the first time mentioned by name as the
          human instruments employed by Jehovah to execute His judgment on
          Egypt. After the slaughter of the inhabitants, the next consequence
          of the invasion is the destruction of the canals and reservoirs and
          the decay of the system of irrigation on which the productiveness
          of the country depended. <span class="tei tei-q">“The rivers
          [canals] are dried up, and the land is made waste, and the fulness
          thereof, by the hand of strangers”</span> (ver. 12). And with the
          material fabric of her prosperity the complicated system of
          religious and civil institutions which was entwined with the hoary
          civilisation of Egypt vanishes for ever. <span class=

          gods. They also possessed some special military or political
          importance, so that with their destruction the sceptres of Egypt

          20-26.—A new oracle, dated three months later than the preceding.
          Pharaoh is represented as a combatant, already disabled in one arm
          and sore pressed by his powerful antagonist the king of Babylon.
          Jehovah announces that the wounded arm cannot be healed, although
          he has retired from the contest for that purpose. On the contrary,
          both his arms shall be broken and the sword struck from his grasp,
          while the arms of Nebuchadnezzar are strengthened by Jehovah, who
          puts His own sword into his hand. The land of Egypt, thus rendered
          defenceless, falls an easy prey to the Chaldæans, and its people
          are dispersed among the nations. The occasion of the prophecy is
          the repulse of Hophra's expedition for the relief of Jerusalem,
          which is referred to as a past event. The date may either mark the

          to the knowledge of Ezekiel. The prophet at all events accepts this

          realisation of his predictions in the total submission of the proud
          empire of the Nile.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Ch. xxxi.
          occupies the same position in the prophecies against Egypt as the
          allegory of the richly laden ship in those against Tyre (ch.
          xxvii.). The incomparable majesty and overshadowing power of Egypt
          are set forth under the image of a lordly cedar in Lebanon, whose
          top reaches to the clouds and whose branches afford shelter to all
          the beasts of the earth. The exact force of the allegory is
          somewhat obscured by a slight error of the text, which must have
          crept in at a very early period. As it stands in the Hebrew and in
          all the ancient versions the whole chapter is a description of the
          greatness not of Egypt but of Assyria. <span class="tei tei-q">“To
          whom art thou like in thy greatness?”</span> asks the prophet (ver.
          2); and the answer is, <span class="tei tei-q">“Assyria was great
          as thou art, yet Assyria fell and is no more.”</span> There is thus
          a double comparison: Assyria is compared to a cedar, and then Egypt
          is tacitly compared to Assyria. This interpretation may not be
          altogether indefensible. That the fate of Assyria contained a
          warning against the pride of Pharaoh is a thought in itself
          intelligible, and such as Ezekiel might very well have expressed.
          But if he had wished to express it, he would not have done it so
          awkwardly as this interpretation supposes. When we follow the
          connection of ideas we cannot fail to see that Assyria is not in
          the prophet's thoughts at all. The image is consistently pursued
          without a break to the end of the chapter, and then we learn that
          the subject of the description is <span class="tei tei-q">“Pharaoh
          and all his multitude”</span> (ver. 18). But if the writer is
          thinking of Egypt at the end, he must have been thinking of it from
          the beginning, and the mention of Assyria is out of place and
          misleading. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page273">[pg

          the answer to the question of ver. 2 is that the position of Egypt
          is as unrivalled among the kingdoms of the world as this stately
          tree among the trees of the forest.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With this
          alteration the course of thought is perfectly clear, although
          incongruous elements are combined in the representation. The
          towering height of the cedar with its top in the clouds symbolises
          the imposing might of Egypt and its ungodly pride (cf. vv. 10, 14).
          The waters of the flood which nourish its roots are those of the
          Nile, the source of Egypt's wealth and greatness. The birds that
          build their nests in its branches and the beasts that bring forth
          their young under its shadow are the smaller nations that looked to
          Egypt for protection and support. Finally, the trees in the garden
          of God who envy the luxuriant pride of this monarch of the forest
          represent the other great empires of the earth who vainly aspired
          to emulate the prosperity and magnificence of Egypt (vv. 3-9).</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the next
          strophe (vv. 10-14) we see the great trunk lying prone across
          mountain and valley, while its branches lie broken in all the
          water-courses. A <span class="tei tei-q">“mighty one of the
          nations”</span> (Nebuchadnezzar) has gone up against it, and felled
          it to the earth. The nations have been scared from under its
          shadow; and the tree which <span class="tei tei-q">“but yesterday
          might have stood against the world”</span> now lies prostrate and
          dishonoured—<span class="tei tei-q">“none so poor as do it
          reverence.”</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page274">[pg
          274]</span><a name="Pg274" id="Pg274" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          And the fall of the cedar reveals a moral principle and conveys a
          moral lesson to all other proud and stately trees. Its purpose is
          to remind the other great empires that they too are mortal, and to
          warn them against the soaring ambition and lifting up of the heart
          which had brought about the humiliation of Egypt: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“that none of the trees by the water should exalt
          themselves in stature or shoot their tops between the clouds, and
          that their mighty ones should not stand proudly in their loftiness
          (all who are fed by water); for they are all delivered to death, to
          the under-world with the children of men, to those that go down to
          the pit.”</span> In reality there is no more impressive intimation
          of the vanity of earthly glory than the decay of those mighty
          empires and civilisations which once stood in the van of human
          progress; nor is there a fitter emblem of their fate than the
          sudden crash of some great forest tree before the woodman's
          axe.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The development
          of the prophet's thought, however, here reaches a point where it
          breaks through the allegory, which has been hitherto consistently
          maintained. All nature shudders in sympathy with the fallen cedar:
          the deep mourns and withholds her streams from the earth; Lebanon
          is clothed with blackness, and all the trees languish. Egypt was so
          much a part of the established order that the world does not know
          itself when she has vanished. While this takes place on earth, the
          cedar itself has gone down to Sheôl, where the other shades of
          vanished dynasties are comforted because this mightiest of them all
          has become like to the rest. This is the answer to the question
          that introduced the allegory. To whom art thou like? None is fit to
          be compared to thee; yet <span class="tei tei-q">“thou shalt be
          brought down with the trees of Eden to the lower parts of the
          earth, thou shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised, with them
          that are slain of the sword.”</span> It <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page275">[pg 275]</span><a name="Pg275" id="Pg275" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> is needless to enlarge on this idea, which is
          out of keeping here, and is more adequately treated in the next
          chapter.</p>

          <div class="tei tei-tb">

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Ch. xxxii.
          consists of two lamentations to be chanted over the fall of Egypt
          by the prophet and the daughters of the nations (vv. 16, 18). The
          first (vv. 1-16) describes the destruction of Pharaoh, and the
          effect which is produced on earth; while the second (vv. 17-32)
          follows his shade into the abode of the dead, and expatiates on the
          welcome that awaits him there. Both express the spirit of
          exultation over a fallen foe, which was one of the uses to which
          elegiac poetry was turned amongst the Hebrews. The first passage,
          however, can hardly be considered a dirge in any proper sense of
          the word. It is essential to a true elegy that the subject of it
          should be conceived as dead, and that whether serious or ironical
          it should celebrate a glory that has passed away. In this case the
          elegiac note (of the elegiac <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">measure</span></em> there is hardly a trace)
          is just struck in the opening line: <span class="tei tei-q">“O
          young lion of the nations! [How] art thou undone!”</span> But this
          is not sustained: the passage immediately falls into the style of
          direct prediction and threatening, and is indeed closely parallel
          to the opening prophecy of the series (ch. xxix.). The fundamental
          image is the same: that of a great Nile monster spouting from his
          nostrils and fouling the waters with his feet (ver. 2). His capture
          by many nations and his lingering death on the open field are
          described with the realistic and ghastly details naturally
          suggested by the figure (vv. 3-6). The image is then abruptly
          changed in order to set forth the effect of so great a calamity on
          the world of nature and of mankind. Pharaoh is compared to a
          brilliant luminary, whose sudden extinction is followed by a
          darkening of all the lights of heaven and by consternation amongst
          the nations and kings of earth (vv. 7-10). It is thought
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page276">[pg 276]</span><a name=
          "Pg276" id="Pg276" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> by some that the
          violence of the transition is to be explained by the idea of the
          heavenly constellation of the dragon, answering to the dragon of
          the Nile, to which Egypt had just been likened.<a id="noteref_114"
          name="noteref_114" href="#note_114"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">114</span></span></a>
          Finally all metaphors are abandoned, and the desolation of Egypt is
          announced in literal terms as accomplished by the sword of the king
          of Babylon and the <span class="tei tei-q">“most terrible of the
          nations”</span> (vv. 11-16).</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But all the
          foregoing oracles are surpassed in grandeur of conception by the
          remarkable Vision of Hades which concludes the series—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“one of the most weird passages in literature”</span>
          (Davidson). In form it is a dirge supposed to be sung at the burial
          of Pharaoh and his host by the prophet along with the daughters of
          famous nations (ver. 18). But the theme, as has been already
          observed, is the entrance of the deceased warriors into the
          under-world, and their reception by the shades that have gone down
          thither before them. In order to understand it we must bear in mind
          some features of the conception of the under-world, which it is
          difficult for the modern mind to realise distinctly. First of all,
          Sheôl or the <span class="tei tei-q">“pit,”</span> the realm of the
          dead, is pictured to the imagination as an adumbration of the grave
          or sepulchre, in which the body finds its last resting-place; or
          rather it is the aggregate of all the burying-grounds scattered
          over the earth's surface. There the shades are grouped according to
          their clans and nationalities, just as on earth the members of the
          same family would usually be interred in one burying-place. The
          grave of the chief or king, the representative of the nation, is
          surrounded by those of his vassals and subjects, earthly
          distinctions being thus far preserved. The condition of the dead
          appears to be one of rest or <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page277">[pg 277]</span><a name="Pg277" id="Pg277" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> sleep; yet they retain some consciousness of
          their state, and are visited at least by transient gleams of human
          emotion, as when in this chapter the heroes rouse themselves to
          address the Pharaoh when he comes among them. The most material
          point is that the state of the soul in Hades reflects the fate of
          the body after death. Those who have received the honour of decent
          burial on earth enjoy a corresponding honour among the shades
          below. They have as it were a definite status and individuality in
          their eternal abode, whilst the spirits of the unburied slain are
          laid in the lowest recesses of the pit, in the limbo of the
          uncircumcised. On this distinction the whole significance of the
          passage before us seems to depend. The dead are divided into two
          great classes: on the one hand the <span class="tei tei-q">“mighty
          ones,”</span> who lie in state with their weapons of war around
          them; and on the other hand the multitude of <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the uncircumcised,<a id="noteref_115" name=
          "noteref_115" href="#note_115"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">115</span></span></a> slain
          by the sword”</span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, those who have perished on
          the field of battle and been buried promiscuously without due
          funereal rites.<a id="noteref_116" name="noteref_116" href=
          "#note_116"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">116</span></span></a> There
          is, however, no moral distinction between the two classes. The
          heroes are not in a state of blessedness; nor is the condition of
          the uncircumcised one of acute suffering. The whole of existence in
          Sheôl is essentially of one character; it is on the whole a
          pitiable existence, destitute of joy and of all that makes up the
          fulness of life on <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page278">[pg
          278]</span><a name="Pg278" id="Pg278" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          earth. Only there is <span class="tei tei-q">“within that deep a
          lower deep,”</span> and it is reserved for those who in the manner
          of their death have experienced the penalty of great wickedness.
          The moral truth of Ezekiel's representation lies here. The real
          judgment of Egypt was enacted in the historical scene of its final
          overthrow; and it is the consciousness of this tremendous
          visitation of divine justice, perpetuated amongst the shades to all
          eternity, that gives ethical significance to the lot assigned to
          the nation in the other world. At the same time it should not be
          overlooked that the passage is in the highest degree poetical, and
          cannot be taken as an exact statement of what was known or believed
          about the state after death in Old Testament times. It deals only
          with the fate of armies and nationalities and great warriors who
          filled the earth with their renown. These, having vanished from
          history, preserve through all time in the under-world the memory of
          Jehovah's mighty acts of judgment; but it is impossible to
          determine whether this sublime vision implies a real belief in the
          persistence of national identities in the region of the dead.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These, then, are
          the principal ideas on which the ode is based, and the course of
          thought is as follows. Ver. 18 briefly announces the occasion for
          which the dirge is composed; it is to celebrate the passage of
          Pharaoh and his host to the lower world, and consign him to his
          appointed place there. Then follows a scene which has a certain
          resemblance to a well-known representation in the fourteenth
          chapter of Isaiah (vv. 9-11). The heroes who occupy the place of
          honour among the dead are supposed to rouse themselves at the
          approach of this great multitude, and hailing them from the midst
          of Sheôl, direct them to their proper place amongst the dishonoured
          slain. <span class="tei tei-q">“The mighty ones speak to him:
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘Be thou in the recesses of the pit: whom
          dost thou <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page279">[pg
          279]</span><a name="Pg279" id="Pg279" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          excel in beauty? Go down and be laid to rest with the
          uncircumcised, in the midst of them that are slain with the
          sword.’</span> ”</span><a id="noteref_117" name="noteref_117" href=
          "#note_117"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">117</span></span></a>
          Thither Pharaoh has been preceded by other great conquerors who
          once set their terror in the earth, but now bear their shame
          amongst those that go down to the pit. For there is Asshur and all
          his company: there too are Elam and Meshech and Tubal, each
          occupying its own allotment amongst nations that have perished by
          the sword (vv. 22-26). Not theirs is the enviable lot of the heroes
          of old time<a id="noteref_118" name="noteref_118" href=
          "#note_118"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">118</span></span></a> who
          went down to Sheôl in their panoply of war, and rest with their
          swords under their heads and their shields<a id="noteref_119" name=
          "noteref_119" href="#note_119"><span class=

          covering their bones. And so Egypt, which has perished like these
          other nations, must be banished with them into the bottom of the
          pit (vv. 27, 28). The enumeration of the nations of the
          uncircumcised is then resumed; Israel's immediate neighbours are
          amongst them—Edom and the dynasties of the north (the Syrians), and
          the Phœnicians, inferior states which played no great part as
          conquerors, but nevertheless perished in battle and bear their
          humiliation along with the others (vv. 29, 30). These are to be
          Pharaoh's companions in his last resting-place, and at the sight of
          them he will lay aside his presumptuous thoughts and comfort
          himself over the loss of his mighty army (vv. 31 f.).</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is necessary
          to say a few words in conclusion about the historical evidence for
          the fulfilment of these prophecies on Egypt. The supplementary
          oracle of ch. xxix. 17-21 shows us that the threatened invasion by
          Nebuchadnezzar <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page280">[pg
          280]</span><a name="Pg280" id="Pg280" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          had not taken place sixteen years after the fall of Jerusalem. Did
          it ever take place at all? Ezekiel was at that time confident that
          his words were on the point of being fulfilled, and indeed he seems
          to stake his credit with his hearers on their verification. Can we
          suppose that he was entirely mistaken? Is it likely that the
          remarkably definite predictions uttered both by him and
          Jeremiah<a id="noteref_120" name="noteref_120" href=
          "#note_120"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">120</span></span></a>
          failed of even the partial fulfilment which that on Tyre received?
          A number of critics have strongly maintained that we are shut up by
          the historical evidence to this conclusion. They rely chiefly on
          the silence of Herodotus, and on the unsatisfactory character of
          the statement of Josephus. The latter writer is indeed sufficiently
          explicit in his affirmations. He tells us<a id="noteref_121" name=
          "noteref_121" href="#note_121"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">121</span></span></a> that
          five years after the capture of Jerusalem Nebuchadnezzar invaded
          Egypt, put to death the reigning king, appointed another in his
          stead, and carried the Jewish refugees in Egypt captive to Babylon.
          But it is pointed out that the date is impossible, being
          inconsistent with Ezekiel's own testimony, that the account of the
          death of Hophra is contradicted by what we know of the matter from
          other sources (Herodotus and Diodorus), and that the whole passage
          bears the appearance of a translation into history of the
          prophecies of Jeremiah which it professes to substantiate. That is
          vigorous criticism, but the vigour is perhaps not altogether
          unwarrantable, especially as Josephus does not mention any
          authority. Other allusions by secular writers hardly count for
          much, and the state of the question is such that historians would
          probably have been content to confess their ignorance if the credit
          of a prophet had not been mixed up with it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Within the last
          seventeen years, however, a new turn <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          "tei tei-anchor"></a> has been given to the discussion through the
          discovery of monumental evidence which was thought to have an
          important bearing on the point in dispute. In the same volume of an
          Egyptological magazine<a id="noteref_122" name="noteref_122" href=

          Wiedemann directed the attention of scholars to two inscriptions,
          one in the Louvre and the other in the British Museum, both of
          which he considered to furnish proof of an occupation of Egypt by
          Nebuchadnezzar. The first was an Egyptian inscription of the reign
          of Hophra. It was written by an official of the highest rank, named
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Nes-hor</span></span>, to whom was entrusted
          the responsible task of defending Egypt on its southern or
          Ethiopian frontier. According to Wiedemann's translation, it
          relates among other things an irruption of Asiatic bands (Syrians,
          people of the north, Asiatics), which penetrated as far as the
          first cataract, and did some damage to the temple of Chnum in
          Elephantine. There they were checked by Nes-hor, and afterwards
          they were crushed or expelled by Hophra himself. Now the most
          natural explanation of this incident, in connection with the
          circumstances of the time, would seem to be that Nebuchadnezzar,
          finding himself fully occupied for the present with the siege of
          Tyre, incited roving bands of Arabs and Syrians to plunder Egypt,
          and that they succeeded so far as to penetrate to the extreme south
          of the country. But a more recent examination of the text, by
          Maspero and Brugsch,<a id="noteref_123" name="noteref_123" href=
          "#note_123"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">123</span></span></a>
          reduces the incident to much smaller dimensions. They find that it
          refers to a mutiny of Egyptian mercenaries (Syrians, Ionians, and
          Bedouins) stationed on the southern frontier. The governor,
          Nes-hor, congratulates himself on a successful stratagem by which
          he got the rebels into a position where they were cut down by the
          king's troops. In any case it is evident <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page282">[pg 282]</span><a name="Pg282" id="Pg282" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> that it falls very far short of a
          confirmation of Ezekiel's prophecy. Not only is there no mention of
          Nebuchadnezzar or a regular Babylonian army, but the invaders or
          mutineers are actually said to have been annihilated by Hophra. It
          may be said, no doubt, that an Egyptian governor was likely to be
          silent about an event which cast discredit on his country's arms,
          and would be tempted to magnify some temporary success into a
          decisive victory. But still the inscription must be taken for what
          it is worth, and the story it tells is certainly not the story of a
          Chaldæan supremacy in the valley of the Nile. The only thing that
          suggests a connection between the two is the general probability
          that a campaign against Egypt must have been contemplated by
          Nebuchadnezzar about that time.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The second and
          more important document is a cuneiform fragment of the annals of
          Nebuchadnezzar. It is unfortunately in a very mutilated condition,
          and all that the Assyriologists have made out is that in the
          thirty-seventh year of his reign Nebuchadnezzar fought a battle
          with the king of Egypt. As the words of the inscription are those
          of Nebuchadnezzar himself, we may presume that the battle ended in
          a victory for him, and a few disconnected words in the later part
          are thought to refer to the tribute or booty which he
          acquired.<a id="noteref_124" name="noteref_124" href=

          thirty-seventh year of Nebuchadnezzar is the year 568 <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, about two years
          after the date of Ezekiel's last utterance against Egypt. The
          Egyptian king at this time was Amasis, whose name (only the last
          syllable of which is legible) is supposed to be that mentioned in
          the inscription.<a id="noteref_125" name="noteref_125" href=

          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page283">[pg 283]</span><a name=
          "Pg283" id="Pg283" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the ulterior
          consequences of this victory were on Egyptian history, or how long
          the Babylonian domination lasted, we cannot at present say. These
          are questions on which we may reasonably look for further light
          from the researches of Assyriology. In the meantime it appears to
          be established beyond reasonable doubt that Nebuchadnezzar did
          attack Egypt, and the probable issue of his expedition was in
          accordance with Ezekiel's latest prediction: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Behold, I give to Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, the
          land of Egypt; and he shall spoil her spoil, and plunder her
          plunder, and it shall be the wages for his army”</span> (ch. xxix.
          19). There can of course be no question of a fulfilment of the
          earlier prophecies in their literal terms. History knows nothing of
          a total captivity of the population of Egypt or a blank of forty
          years in her annals when her land was untrodden by the foot of man
          or of beast. These are details belonging to the dramatic form in
          which the prophet clothed the spiritual lesson which it was
          necessary to impress on his countrymen—the inherent weakness of the
          Egyptian empire as a power based on material resources and rearing
          itself in opposition to the great ends of God's kingdom. And it may
          well have been that for the illustration of that truth the
          humiliation that Egypt endured at the hands of Nebuchadnezzar was
          as effective as her total destruction would have been.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One day in
          January of the year 586 the tidings circulated through the Jewish
          colony at Tel-abib that <span class="tei tei-q">“the city was
          smitten.”</span> The rapidity with which in the East intelligence
          is transmitted through secret channels has often excited the
          surprise of European observers. In this case there is no
          extraordinary rapidity to note, for the fate of Jerusalem had been
          decided nearly six months before it was known in Babylon.<a id=
          "noteref_126" name="noteref_126" href="#note_126"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          it is remarkable that the first intimation of the issue of the
          siege was brought to the exiles by one of their own countrymen, who
          had escaped at the capture of the city. It is probable that the
          messenger did not set out at once, but waited until he could bring
          some information as to how matters were settling down after the
          war. Or he may have been a captive who had trudged the weary road
          to Babylon in chains under the escort of Nebuzaradan, captain of
          the guard,<a id="noteref_127" name="noteref_127" href=
          "#note_127"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">127</span></span></a> and
          afterwards succeeded in making <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page288">[pg 288]</span><a name="Pg288" id="Pg288" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> his escape to the older settlement where
          Ezekiel lived. All we know is that his message was not delivered
          with the despatch which would have been possible if his journey had
          been unimpeded, and that in the meantime the official intelligence
          which must have already reached Babylon had not transpired among
          the exiles who were waiting so anxiously for tidings of the fate of
          Jerusalem.<a id="noteref_128" name="noteref_128" href=
          "#note_128"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The immediate
          effect of the announcement on the mind of the exiles is not
          recorded. It was doubtless received with all the signs of public
          mourning which Ezekiel had anticipated and foretold.<a id=
          "noteref_129" name="noteref_129" href="#note_129"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">129</span></span></a> They
          would require some time to adjust themselves to a situation for
          which, in spite of all the warnings that had been sent them, they
          were utterly unprepared; and it must have been uncertain at first
          what direction their thoughts would take. Would they carry out
          their half-formed intention of abandoning their national faith and
          assimilating themselves to the surrounding heathenism? Would they
          sink into the lethargy of despair, and pine away under a confused
          consciousness of guilt? Or would they repent of their unbelief, and
          turn to embrace the hope which God's mercy held out to them in the
          teaching of the prophet whom they had despised? All this was for
          the moment uncertain; but one thing was certain—they could no more
          return to the attitude of complacent indifference and incredulity
          in which they had hitherto resisted the word of Jehovah. The day on
          which the tidings of the city's destruction fell like a thunderbolt
          in the community of Tel-abib was the turning-point of Ezekiel's
          ministry. In the arrival of the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“fugitive”</span> he recognises the sign which was to
          break the spell of silence which had lain so long <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page289">[pg 289]</span><a name="Pg289" id="Pg289"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> upon him, and set him free for the
          ministry of consolation and upbuilding which was henceforth to be
          his chief vocation. A presentiment of what was coming had visited
          him the evening before his interview with the messenger, and from
          that time <span class="tei tei-q">“his mouth was opened, and he was
          no more dumb”</span> (ver. 22). Hitherto he had preached to deaf
          ears, and the echo of his ineffectual appeals had come back in a
          deadening sense of failure which had paralysed his activity. But
          now in one moment the veil of prejudice and vain self-confidence is
          torn from the heart of his hearers, and gradually but surely the
          whole burden of his message must disclose itself to their
          intelligence. The time has come to work for the formation of a new
          Israel, and a new spirit of hopefulness stimulates the prophet to
          throw himself eagerly into the career which is thus opened up
          before him.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It may be well
          at this point to try to realise the state of mind which emerged
          amongst Ezekiel's hearers after the first shock of consternation
          had passed away. The seven chapters (xxxiii.-xxxix.) with which we
          are to be occupied in this section all belong to the second period
          of the prophet's work, and in all probability to the earlier part
          of that period. It is obvious, however, that they were not written
          under the first impulse of the tidings of the fall of Jerusalem.
          They contain allusions to certain changes which must have occupied
          some time; and simultaneously a change took place in the temper of
          the people resulting ultimately in a definite spiritual situation
          to which the prophet had to address himself. It is this situation
          which we have to try to understand. It supplies the external
          conditions of Ezekiel's ministry, and unless we can in some measure
          interpret it we shall lose the full meaning of his teaching in this
          important period of his ministry.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page290">[pg 290]</span><a name="Pg290" id="Pg290" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the outset we
          may glance at the state of those who were left in the land of
          Israel, who in a sense formed part of Ezekiel's audience. The very
          first oracle uttered by him after he had received his emancipation
          was a threat of judgment against these survivors of the nation's
          calamity (vv. 23-29). The fact that this is recorded in connection
          with the interview with the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“fugitive”</span> may mean that the information on
          which it is based was obtained from that somewhat shadowy
          personage. Whether in this way or through some later channel,
          Ezekiel had apparently some knowledge of the disastrous feuds which
          had followed the destruction of Jerusalem. These events are
          minutely described in the end of the book of Jeremiah (chs.
          xl.-xliv.). With a clemency which in the circumstances is
          surprising the king of Babylon had allowed a small remnant of the
          people to settle in the land, and had appointed over them a native
          governor, Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, who fixed his residence at
          Mizpah. The prophet Jeremiah elected to throw in his lot with this
          remnant, and for a time it seemed as if through peaceful submission
          to the Chaldæan supremacy all might go well with the survivors. The
          chiefs who had conducted the guerilla warfare in the open against
          the Babylonian army came in and placed themselves under the
          protection of Gedaliah, and there was every prospect that by
          refraining from projects of rebellion they might be left to enjoy
          the fruits of the land without disturbance. But this was not to be.
          Certain turbulent spirits under Ishmael, a member of the royal
          family, entered into a conspiracy with the king of Ammon to destroy
          this last refuge of peace-loving Israelites. Gedaliah was
          treacherously murdered; and although the murder was partially
          avenged, Ishmael succeeded in making his escape to the Ammonites,
          while the remains of the party of order, dreading the vengeance of
          Nebuchadnezzar, took their <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page291">[pg 291]</span><a name="Pg291" id="Pg291" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> departure for Egypt and carried Jeremiah
          forcibly with them. What happened after this we do not know; but it
          is not improbable that Ishmael and his followers may have held
          possession of the land by force for some years. We read of a fresh
          deportation of Judæan captives to Babylon five years after the
          capture of Jerusalem (Jer. lii. 30); and this may have been the
          result of an expedition to suppress the depredations of the robber
          band that Ishmael had gathered round him. How much of this story
          had reached the ears of Ezekiel we do not know; but there is one
          allusion in his oracle which makes it probable that he had at least
          heard of the assassination of Gedaliah. Those he addresses are men
          who <span class="tei tei-q">“stand upon their sword”</span>—that is
          to say, they hold that might is right, and glory in deeds of blood
          and violence that gratify their passionate desire for revenge. Such
          language could hardly be used of any section of the remaining
          population of Judæa except the lawless banditti that enrolled
          themselves under the banner of Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What Ezekiel is
          mainly concerned with, however, is the moral and religious
          condition of those to whom he speaks. Strange to say, they were
          animated by a species of religious fanaticism, which led them to
          regard themselves as the legitimate heirs to whom the reversion of
          the land of Israel belonged. <span class="tei tei-q">“Abraham was
          one,”</span> so reasoned these desperadoes, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“and yet he inherited the land: but we are many; to us
          the land is given for a possession”</span> (ver. 24). Their meaning
          is that the smallness of their number is no argument against the
          validity of their claim to the heritage of the land. They are still
          many in comparison with the solitary patriarch to whom it was first
          promised; and if he was multiplied so as to take possession of it,
          why should they hesitate to claim the mastery of it? This thought
          of the wonderful multiplication of <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page292">[pg 292]</span><a name="Pg292" id="Pg292" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> Abraham's seed after he had received the
          promise seems to have laid fast hold of the men of that generation.
          It is applied by the great teacher who stands next to Ezekiel in
          the prophetic succession to comfort the little flock who followed
          after righteousness and could hardly believe that it was God's good
          pleasure to give them the kingdom. <span class="tei tei-q">“Look
          unto Abraham your father, and unto Sarah that bare you: for I
          called him alone, and blessed him, and increased him”</span> (Isa.
          li. 2). The words of the infatuated men who exulted in the havoc
          they were making on the mountains of Judæa may sound to us like a
          blasphemous travesty of this argument; but they were no doubt
          seriously meant. They afford one more instance of the boundless
          capacity of the Jewish race for religious self-delusion, and their
          no less remarkable insensibility to that in which the essence of
          religion lay. The men who uttered this proud boast were the
          precursors of those who in the days of the Baptist thought to say
          within themselves, <span class="tei tei-q">“We have Abraham to our
          father,”</span> not understanding that God was able <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“of these stones to raise up children to
          Abraham”</span> (Matt. iii. 9). All the while they were
          perpetuating the evils for which the judgment of God had descended
          on the city and the Hebrew state. Idolatry, ceremonial impurity,
          bloodshed, and adultery were rife amongst them (vv. 25, 26); and no
          misgiving seems to have entered their minds that because of these
          things the wrath of God comes on the children of disobedience. And
          therefore the prophet repudiates their pretensions with
          indignation. <span class="tei tei-q">“Shall ye possess the
          land?”</span> Their conduct simply showed that judgment had not had
          its perfect work, and that Jehovah's purpose would not be
          accomplished until <span class="tei tei-q">“the land was laid waste
          and desolate, and the pomp of her strength should cease, and the
          mountains of Israel be desolate, so that none passed
          through”</span> (ver. 28). We have seen that in all likelihood this
          prediction was fulfilled <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page293">[pg
          293]</span><a name="Pg293" id="Pg293" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          by a punitive expedition from Babylonia in the twenty-third year of
          Nebuchadnezzar.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But we knew
          before that Ezekiel expected no good thing to come of the survivors
          of the judgment in Judæa. His hope was in those who had passed
          through the fires of banishment, the men amongst whom his own work
          lay, and amongst whom he looked for the first signs of the
          outpouring of the divine Spirit. We must now return to the inner
          circle of Ezekiel's immediate hearers, and consider the change
          which the calamity had produced on them. The chapter now before us
          yields two glimpses into the inner life of the people which help us
          to realise the kind of men with whom the prophet had to do.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the first
          place it is interesting to learn that in his more frequent public
          appearances the prophet rapidly acquired a considerable reputation
          as a popular preacher (vv. 30-33). It is true that the interest
          which he excited was not of the most wholesome kind. It became a
          favourite amusement of the people hanging about the walls and doors
          to come and listen to the fervid oratory of their one remaining
          prophet as he declared to them <span class="tei tei-q">“the word
          that came forth from Jehovah.”</span> It is to be feared that the
          substance of his message counted for little in their appreciative
          and critical listening. He was to them <span class="tei tei-q">“as
          a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice, and can play
          well on an instrument”</span>: <span class="tei tei-q">“they heard
          his words, but did them not.”</span> It was pleasant to subject
          oneself now and then to the influence of this powerful and
          heart-searching preacher; but somehow the heart was never searched,
          the conscience was never stirred, and the hearing never ripened
          into serious conviction and settled purpose of amendment. The
          people were thoroughly respectful in their demeanour and apparently
          devout, coming in crowds and sitting before him as God's people
          should. But they were preoccupied: <span class="tei tei-q">“their
          heart went <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page294">[pg
          294]</span><a name="Pg294" id="Pg294" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          after their gain”</span> (ver. 31) or their advantage.
          Self-interest prevented them from receiving the word of God in
          honest and good hearts, and no change was visible in their conduct.
          Hence the prophet is not disposed to regard the evidences of his
          newly acquired popularity with much satisfaction. It presents
          itself to his mind as a danger against which he has to be on his
          guard. He has been tried by opposition and apparent failure; now he
          is exposed to the more insidious temptation of a flattering
          reception and superficial success. It is a tribute to his power,
          and an opportunity such as he had never before enjoyed. Whatever
          may have been the case heretofore, he is now sure of an audience,
          and his position has suddenly become one of great influence in the
          community. But the same resolute confidence in the truth of his
          message which sustained Ezekiel amidst the discouragements of his
          earlier career saves him now from the fatal attractions of
          popularity to which many men in similar circumstances have yielded.
          He is not deceived by the favourable disposition of the people
          towards himself, nor is he tempted to cultivate his oratorical
          gifts with a view to sustaining their admiration. His one concern
          is to utter the word that shall come to pass, and so to declare the
          counsel of God that men shall be compelled in the end to
          acknowledge that he has been <span class="tei tei-q">“a prophet
          among them”</span> (ver. 33). We may be thankful to the prophet for
          this little glimpse from a vanished past—one of those touches of
          nature that make the whole world kin. But we ought not to miss its
          obvious moral. Ezekiel is the prototype of all popular preachers,
          and he knew their peculiar trials. He was perhaps the first man who
          ministered regularly to an attached congregation, who came to hear
          him because they liked it and because they had nothing better to
          do. If he passed unscathed through the dangers of the position, it
          was through his <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page295">[pg
          295]</span><a name="Pg295" id="Pg295" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          overpowering sense of the reality of divine things and the
          importance of men's spiritual destiny; and also we may add through
          his fidelity in a department of ministerial duty which popular
          preachers are sometimes apt to neglect—the duty of close personal
          dealing with individual men about their sins and their state before
          God. To this subject we shall revert by-and-by.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This passage
          reveals to us the people in their lighter moods, when they were
          able to cast off the awful burden of life and destiny and take
          advantage of such sources of enjoyment as their circumstances
          afforded. Mental dejection in a community, from whatever cause it
          originates, is rarely continuous. The natural elasticity of the
          mind asserts itself in the most depressing circumstances; and the
          tension of almost unendurable sorrow is relieved by outbursts of
          unnatural gaiety. Hence we need not be surprised to find that
          beneath the surface levity of these exiles there lurked the feeling
          of despair expressed in the words of ver. 10 and more fully in
          those of ch. xxxvii. 11: <span class="tei tei-q">“Our
          transgressions and our sins are upon us, and we waste away in them:
          how should we then live?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Our bones
          are dried, and our hope is lost: we are cut off.”</span> These
          accents of despondency reflect the new mood into which the more
          serious-minded portion of the community had been plunged by the
          calamities that had befallen them. The bitterness of unavailing
          remorse, the consciousness of national death, had laid fast hold of
          their spirits and deprived them of the power of hope. In sober
          truth the nation was dead beyond apparent hope of revival; and to
          an Israelite, whose spiritual interests were all identified with
          those of his nation, religion had no power of consolation apart
          from a national future. The people therefore abandoned themselves
          to despair, and hardened themselves against the appeals which the
          prophet addressed to them in the name of Jehovah. They <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page296">[pg 296]</span><a name="Pg296" id="Pg296"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> looked on themselves as the victims of
          an inexorable fate, and were disposed perhaps to resent the call to
          repentance as a trifling with the misery of the unfortunate.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And yet,
          although this state of mind was as far removed as possible from the
          godly sorrow that worketh repentance, it was a step towards the
          accomplishment of the promise of redemption. For the present,
          indeed, it rendered the people more impenetrable than ever to the
          word of God. But it meant that they had accepted in principle the
          prophetic interpretation of their history. It was no longer
          possible to deny that Jehovah the God of Israel had revealed His
          secret to His servants the prophets. He was not such a Being as the
          popular imagination had figured. Israel had not known Him; only the
          prophets had spoken of Him the thing that was right. Thus for the
          first time a general conviction of sin, a sense of being in the
          wrong, was produced in Israel. That this conviction should at first
          lead to the verge of despair was perhaps inevitable. The people
          were not familiar with the idea of the divine righteousness, and
          could not at once perceive that anger against sin was consistent in
          God with pity for the sinner and mercy towards the contrite. The
          chief task that now lay before the prophet was to transform their
          attitude of sullen impenitence into one of submission and hope by
          teaching them the efficacy of repentance. They have learned the
          meaning of judgment; they have now to learn the possibility and the
          conditions of forgiveness. And this can only be taught to them
          through a revelation of the free and infinite grace of God, who has
          <span class="tei tei-q">“no pleasure in the death of the wicked,
          but that the wicked should turn from his way and live”</span> (ver.
          11). Only thus can the hard and stony heart be taken away from
          their flesh and a heart of flesh given to them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We can now
          understand the significance of the striking passage which stands as
          the introduction to this whole <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page297">[pg 297]</span><a name="Pg297" id="Pg297" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> section of the book (ch. xxxiii. 1-20). At
          this juncture of his ministry Ezekiel's thoughts went back on an
          aspect of his prophetic vocation which had hitherto been in
          abeyance. From the first he had been conscious of a certain
          responsibility for the fate of each individual within reach of his
          words (ch. iii. 16-21). This truth had been one of the keynotes of
          his ministry; but the practical developments which it suggested had
          been hindered by the solidarity of the opposition which he had
          encountered. As long as Jerusalem stood the exiles had been swayed
          by one common current of feeling—their thoughts were wholly
          occupied by the expectation of an issue that would annul the gloomy
          predictions of Ezekiel; and no man dared to break away from the
          general sentiment and range himself on the side of God's prophet.
          In these circumstances anything of the nature of pastoral activity
          was obviously out of the question. But now that this great obstacle
          to faith was removed there was a prospect that the solidity of
          popular opinion would be broken up, so that the word of God might
          find an entrance here and there into susceptible hearts. The time
          was come to call for personal decisions, to appeal to each man to
          embrace for himself the offer of pardon and salvation. Its
          watchword might have been found in words uttered in another great
          crisis of religious destiny: <span class="tei tei-q">“The kingdom
          of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by
          force.”</span> Out of such <span class="tei tei-q">“violent
          men”</span> who act for themselves and have the courage of their
          convictions the new people of God must be formed; and the mission
          of the prophet is to gather round him all those who are warned by
          his words to <span class="tei tei-q">“flee from the wrath to
          come.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Let us look a
          little more closely at the teaching of these verses. We find that
          Ezekiel restates in the most emphatic manner the theological
          principles which underlie this new development of his prophetic
          duties (vv. 10-20). <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page298">[pg
          298]</span><a name="Pg298" id="Pg298" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          These principles have been considered already in the exposition of
          ch. xviii.; and it is not necessary to do more than refer to them
          here. They are such as these: the exact and absolute righteousness
          of God in His dealings with individuals; His unwillingness that any
          should perish, and His desire that all should be saved and live;
          the necessity of personal repentance; the freedom and independence
          of the individual soul through its immediate relation to God. On
          this closely connected body of evangelical doctrine Ezekiel bases
          the appeal which he now makes to his hearers. What we are specially
          concerned with here, however, is the direction which they imparted
          to his activity. We may study in the light of Ezekiel's example the
          manner in which these fundamental truths of personal religion are
          to be made effective in the ministry of the gospel for the building
          up of the Church of Christ.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The general
          conception is clearly set forth in the figure of the watchman, with
          which the chapter opens (vv. 1-9). The duties of the watchman are
          simple, but responsible. He is set apart in a time of public danger
          to warn the city of the approach of an enemy. The citizens trust
          him and go about their ordinary occupations in security so long as
          the trumpet is not sounded. Should he sleep at his post or neglect
          to give the signal, men are caught unprepared and lives are lost
          through his fault. Their blood is required at the watchman's hand.
          If, on the other hand, he gives the alarm as soon as he sees the
          sword coming, and any man disregards the warning and is cut down in
          his iniquity, his blood is upon his own head. Nothing could be
          clearer than this. Office always involves responsibility, and no
          responsibility could be greater than that of a watchman in time of
          invasion. Those who suffer are in either case the citizens whom the
          sword cuts off; but it makes all the difference in the world
          whether the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page299">[pg
          299]</span><a name="Pg299" id="Pg299" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          blame of their death rests on themselves for their foolhardiness or
          on the watchman for his unfaithfulness. Such then, as Ezekiel goes
          on to explain, is his own position as a prophet. The prophet is one
          who sees further into the spiritual issues of things than other
          men, and discovers the coming calamity which is to them invisible.
          We must notice that a background of danger is presupposed. In what
          form it was to come is not indicated; but Ezekiel knows that
          judgment follows hard at the heels of sin, and seeing sin in his
          fellow-men he knows that their state is one of spiritual peril. The
          prophet's course therefore is clear. His business is to announce as
          in trumpet tones the doom that hangs over every man who persists in
          his wickedness, to re-echo the divine sentence which he alone may
          have heard, <span class="tei tei-q">“O wicked man, thou shalt
          surely die.”</span> And again the main question is one of
          responsibility. The watchman cannot ensure the safety of every
          citizen, because any man may refuse to take the warning he gives.
          No more can the prophet ensure the salvation of all his hearers,
          for each one is free to accept or despise the message. But whether
          men hear or whether they forbear, it is of the utmost moment for
          himself that that warning should be faithfully proclaimed and that
          he should thus <span class="tei tei-q">“deliver his soul.”</span>
          Ezekiel seems to feel that it is only by frankly accepting the
          responsibility which thus devolves on himself that he can hope to
          impress on his hearers the responsibility that rests on them for
          the use they make of his message.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These thoughts
          appear to have occupied the mind of Ezekiel on the eve of his
          emancipation, and must have influenced his subsequent action to an
          extent which we can but vaguely estimate. It is generally
          considered that this description of the prophet's functions covers
          a whole department of work of which no express account is given.
          Ezekiel writes no <span class="tei tei-q">“Pastor's
          Sketches,”</span> and records no <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page300">[pg 300]</span><a name="Pg300" id="Pg300" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> instances of individual conversion through
          his ministry. The unwritten history of the Babylonian captivity
          must have been rich in such incidents of spiritual experience, and
          nothing could have been more instructive to us than the study of a
          few typical cases had it been possible. One of the most interesting
          features of the early history of Mohammedanism is found in the
          narratives of personal adhesion to the new religion; and the
          formation of the new Israel in the age of the Exile is a process of
          infinitely greater importance for humanity at large than the
          genesis of Islam. But neither in this book nor elsewhere are we
          permitted to follow that process in its details. Ezekiel may have
          witnessed the beginnings of it, but he was not called upon to be
          its historian. Still, the inference is probably correct that a
          conception of the prophet's office which holds him accountable to
          God for the fate of individuals led to something more than mere
          general exhortations to repentance. The preacher must have taken a
          personal interest in his hearers; he must have watched for the
          first signs of a response to his message, and been ready to advise
          and encourage those who turned to him for guidance in their
          perplexities. And since the sphere of his influence and
          responsibility included the whole Hebrew community in which he
          lived, he must have been eager to seize every opportunity to warn
          individual sinners of the error of their ways, lest their blood
          should be required at his hand. To this extent we may say that
          Ezekiel held a position amongst the exiles somewhat analogous to
          that of a spiritual director in the Catholic Church or the pastor
          of a Protestant congregation. But the analogy must not be pressed
          too far. The nurture of the spiritual life of individuals could not
          have presented itself to him as the chief end of his ministrations.
          His business was first to lay down the conditions of entrance into
          the new kingdom of God, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page301">[pg
          301]</span><a name="Pg301" id="Pg301" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          and then out of the ruins of the old Israel to make ready a people
          prepared for the Lord. Perhaps the nearest parallel to this
          department of his work which history affords is the mission of the
          Baptist. The keynote of Ezekiel's preaching was the same as that of
          John: <span class="tei tei-q">“Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is
          at hand.”</span> Both prophets were alike animated by a sense of
          crisis and urgency, based on the conviction that the impending
          Messianic age would be ushered in by a searching judgment in which
          the chaff would be separated from the wheat. Both laboured for the
          same end—the formation of a new circle of religious fellowship, in
          anticipation of the advent of the Messianic kingdom. And as John,
          by an inevitable spiritual selection, gathered round him a band of
          disciples, amongst whom our Lord found some of His most devoted
          followers, so we may believe that Ezekiel, by a similar process,
          became the acknowledged leader of those whom he taught to wait for
          the hope of Israel's restoration.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is nothing
          in Ezekiel's ministry that appeals more directly to the Christian
          conscience than the serious and profound sense of pastoral
          responsibility to which this passage bears witness. It is a feeling
          which would seem to be inseparable from the right discharge of the
          ministerial office. In this, as in many other respects, Ezekiel's
          experience is repeated, on a higher level, in that of the apostle
          of the Gentiles, who could take his hearers to record that he was
          <span class="tei tei-q">“pure from the blood of all men,”</span>
          inasmuch as he had <span class="tei tei-q">“taught them publicly
          and from house to house,”</span> and <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“ceased not to warn every one night and day with
          tears”</span> (Acts xx. 17-35). That does not mean, of course, that
          a preacher is to occupy himself with nothing else than the personal
          salvation of his hearers. St. Paul would have been the last to
          agree to such a limitation of the range of his teaching. But it
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page302">[pg 302]</span><a name=
          "Pg302" id="Pg302" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> does mean that the
          salvation of men and women is the supreme end which the minister of
          Christ is to set before him, and that to which all other
          instruction is subordinated. And unless a man realises that the
          truth he utters is of tremendous importance on the destiny of those
          to whom he speaks, he can hardly hope to approve himself as an
          ambassador for Christ. There are doubtless temptations, not in
          themselves ignoble, to use the pulpit for other purposes than this.
          The desire for public influence may be one of them, or the desire
          to utter one's mind on burning questions of the day. To say that
          these are temptations is not to say that matters of public interest
          are to be rigorously excluded from treatment in the pulpit. There
          are many questions of this kind on which the will of God is as
          clear and imperative as it can possibly be on any point of private
          conduct; and even in matters as to which there is legitimate
          difference of opinion amongst Christian men there are underlying
          principles of righteousness which may need to be fearlessly
          enunciated at the risk of obloquy and misunderstanding.
          Nevertheless it remains true that the great end of the gospel
          ministry is to reconcile men to God and to cultivate in individual
          lives the fruits of the Spirit, so as at the last to present every
          man perfect in Christ. And the preacher who may be most safely
          entrusted with the handling of all other questions is he who is
          most intent on the formation of Christian character and most deeply
          conscious of his responsibility for the effect of his teaching on
          the eternal destiny of those to whom he ministers. What is called
          preaching to the age may certainly become a very poor and empty
          thing if it is forgotten that the age is made up of individuals
          each of whom has a soul to save or lose. What shall it profit a man
          if the preacher teaches him how to win the whole world and lose his
          own life? It is fashionable to hold up the prophets of Israel as
          models of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page303">[pg
          303]</span><a name="Pg303" id="Pg303" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          all that a Christian minister ought to be. If that is true,
          prophecy must at least be allowed to speak its whole lesson; and
          amongst other elements Ezekiel's consciousness of responsibility
          for the individual life must receive due recognition.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The term
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Messianic”</span> as commonly applied to
          Old Testament prophecy bears two different senses, a wider and a
          narrower. In its wider use it is almost equivalent to the modern
          word <span class="tei tei-q">“eschatological.”</span> It denotes
          that unquenchable hope of a glorious future for Israel and the
          world which is an all but omnipresent feature of the prophetic
          writings, and includes all predictions of the kingdom of God in its
          final and perfect manifestation. In its stricter sense it is
          applied only to the promise of the ideal king of the house of
          David, which, although a very conspicuous element of prophecy, is
          by no means universal, and perhaps does not bulk quite so largely
          in the Old Testament as is generally supposed. The later Jews were
          guided by a true instinct when they seized on this figure of the
          ideal ruler as the centre of the nation's hope; and to them we owe
          this special application of the name <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Messiah,”</span> the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Anointed,”</span> which is never used of the Son of
          David in the Old Testament itself. To a certain extent we follow in
          their steps when we enlarge the meaning of the word <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Messianic”</span> so as to embrace the whole prophetic
          delineation of the future glories of the kingdom of God.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This distinction
          may be illustrated from the prophecies of Ezekiel. If we take the
          word in its more general sense, we may say that all the chapters
          from the thirty-fourth <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page305">[pg
          305]</span><a name="Pg305" id="Pg305" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          to the end of the book are Messianic in character. That is to say,
          they describe under various aspects the final condition of things
          which is introduced by the restoration of Israel to its own land.
          Let us glance for a moment at the elements which enter into this
          general conception of the last things as they are set forth in the
          section of the book with which we are now dealing. We exclude from
          view for the present the last nine chapters, because there the
          prophet's point of view is somewhat different, and it is better to
          reserve them for separate treatment.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The chapters
          from the thirty-fourth to the thirty-seventh are the necessary
          complement of the call to repentance in the first part of ch.
          xxxiii. Ezekiel has enunciated the conditions of entrance to the
          new kingdom of God, and has urged his hearers to prepare for its
          appearing. He now proceeds to unfold the nature of that kingdom,
          and the process by which Jehovah is to bring it to pass. As has
          been said, the central fact is the restoration of Israel to the
          land of Canaan. Here the prophet found a point of contact with the
          natural aspirations of his fellow-exiles. There was no prospect to
          which they had clung with more eager longing than that of a return
          to national independence in their own land; and the feeling that
          this was no longer possible was the source of the abject despair
          from which the prophet sought to rouse them. How was this to be
          done? Not simply by asserting in the face of all human probability
          that the restoration would take place, but by presenting it to
          their minds in its religious aspects as an object worthy of the
          exercise of almighty power, and an object in which Jehovah was
          interested for the glory of His great name. Only by being brought
          round to Ezekiel's faith in God could the exiles recover their lost
          hope in the future of the nation. Thus the return to which Ezekiel
          looks forward has a Messianic significance; it is the establishment
          of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page306">[pg
          306]</span><a name="Pg306" id="Pg306" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          kingdom of God, a symbol of the final and perfect union between
          Jehovah and Israel.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now in the
          chapters before us this general conception is exhibited in three
          separate pictures of the Restoration, the leading ideas being the
          Monarchy (ch. xxxiv.), the Land (chs. xxxv., xxxvi.), and the
          Nation (ch. xxxvii.). The order in which they are arranged is not
          that which might seem most natural. We should have expected the
          prophet to deal first with the revival of the nation, then with its
          settlement on the soil of Palestine, and last of all with its
          political organisation under a Davidic king. Ezekiel follows the
          reverse order. He begins with the kingdom, as the most complete
          embodiment of the Messianic salvation, and then falls back on its
          two presuppositions—the recovery and purification of the land on
          the one hand, and the restitution of the nation on the other. It is
          doubtful, indeed, whether any logical connection between the three
          pictures is intended. It is perhaps better to regard them as
          expressing three distinct and collateral aspects of the idea of
          redemption, to each of which a certain permanent religious
          significance is attached. They are at all events the outstanding
          elements of Ezekiel's eschatology so far as it is expounded in this
          section of his prophecies.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We thus see that
          the promise of the perfect king—the Messianic idea in its more
          restricted signification—holds a distinct but not a supreme place
          in Ezekiel's vision of the future. It appears for the first time in
          ch. xvii. at the end of an oracle denouncing the perfidy of
          Zedekiah and foretelling the overthrow of his kingdom; and again,
          in a similar connection, in an obscure verse of ch. xxi.<a id=
          "noteref_130" name="noteref_130" href="#note_130"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">130</span></span></a> Both
          these prophecies belong to the time before the fall of the state,
          when the prophet's thoughts were not continuously occupied with the
          hope of the future. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page307">[pg
          307]</span><a name="Pg307" id="Pg307" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          The former is remarkable, nevertheless, for the glowing terms in
          which the greatness of the future kingdom is depicted. From the top
          of the lofty cedar which the great eagle had carried away to
          Babylon Jehovah will take a tender shoot and plant it in the
          mountain height of Israel. There it will strike root and grow up
          into a lordly cedar, under whose branches all the birds of the air
          find refuge. The terms of the allegory have been explained in the
          proper place.<a id="noteref_131" name="noteref_131" href=
          "#note_131"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">131</span></span></a> The
          great cedar is the house of David; the topmost bough which was
          taken to Babylon is the family of Jehoiachin, the direct heirs to
          the throne. The planting of the tender shoot in the land of Israel
          represents the founding of the Messiah's kingdom, which is thus
          proclaimed to be of transcendent earthly magnificence,
          overshadowing all the other kingdoms of the world, and convincing
          the nations that its foundation is the work of Jehovah Himself. In
          this short passage we have the Messianic idea in its simplest and
          most characteristic expression. The hope of the future is bound up
          with the destiny of the house of David; and the re-establishment of
          the kingdom in more than its ancient splendour is the great divine
          act to which all the blessings of the final dispensation are
          attached.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But it is in the
          thirty-fourth chapter that we find the most comprehensive
          exposition of Ezekiel's teaching on the subject of the monarchy and
          the Messianic kingdom. It is perhaps the most political of all his
          prophecies. It is pervaded by a spirit of genuine sympathy with the
          sufferings of the common people, and indignation against the
          tyranny practised and tolerated by the ruling classes. The
          disasters that have befallen the nation down to its final
          dispersion among the heathen are all traced to the misgovernment
          and anarchy for which the monarchy was <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page308">[pg 308]</span><a name="Pg308" id="Pg308" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> primarily responsible. In like manner the
          blessings of the coming age are summed up in the promise of a
          perfect king, ruling in the name of Jehovah and maintaining order
          and righteousness throughout his realm. Nowhere else does Ezekiel
          approach so nearly to the political ideal foreshadowed by the
          statesman-prophet Isaiah of a <span class="tei tei-q">“king
          reigning in righteousness and princes ruling in judgment”</span>
          (Isa. xxxii. 1), securing the enjoyment of universal prosperity and
          peace to the redeemed people of God. It must be remembered of
          course that this is only a partial expression of Ezekiel's
          conception both of the past condition of the nation and of its
          future salvation. We have had abundant evidence<a id="noteref_132"
          name="noteref_132" href="#note_132"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">132</span></span></a> to
          show that he considered all classes of the community to be corrupt,
          and the people as a whole implicated in the guilt of rebellion
          against Jehovah. The statement that the kings have brought about
          the dispersion of the nation must not therefore be pressed to the
          conclusion that civic injustice was the sole cause of Israel's
          calamities. Similarly we shall find that the redemption of the
          people depends on other and more fundamental conditions than the
          establishment of good government under a righteous king. But that
          is no reason for minimising the significance of the passage before
          us as an utterance of Ezekiel's profound interest in social order
          and the welfare of the poor. It shows moreover that the prophet at
          this time attached real importance to the promise of the Messiah as
          the organ of Jehovah's rule over His people. If civil wrongs and
          legalised tyranny were not the only sins which had brought about
          the destruction of the state, they were at least serious evils,
          which could not be tolerated in the new Israel; and the chief
          safeguard against their recurrence is found in the character of the
          ideal ruler whom Jehovah will raise up <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page309">[pg 309]</span><a name="Pg309" id="Pg309" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> from the seed of David. How far this high
          conception of the functions of the monarchy was modified in
          Ezekiel's subsequent teaching we shall see when we come to consider
          the position assigned to the prince in the great vision at the end
          of the book.<a id="noteref_133" name="noteref_133" href=
          "#note_133"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">133</span></span></a></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the meantime
          let us examine somewhat more closely the contents of ch. xxxiv. Its
          leading ideas seem to have been suggested by a Messianic prophecy
          of Jeremiah's with which Ezekiel was no doubt acquainted:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Woe to the shepherds that destroy and
          scatter the flock of My pasture! saith Jehovah. Therefore thus
          saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, against the shepherds that tend
          My people, Ye have scattered My flock, and dispersed them, and have
          not visited them: behold, I will visit upon you the evil of your
          doings, saith Jehovah. And I will gather the remnant of My flock
          from all the lands whither I have dispersed them, and will restore
          them to their folds; and they shall be fruitful and multiply. And I
          will set shepherds over them who shall feed them: and they shall
          not fear any more, nor be frightened, nor be lacking, saith
          Jehovah”</span> (Jer. xxiii. 1-4). Here we have the simple image of
          the flock and its shepherds, which Ezekiel, as his manner is,
          expands into an allegory of the past history and future prospects
          of the nation. How closely he follows the guidance of his
          predecessor will be seen from the analysis of the chapter. It may
          be divided into four parts.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">i. The first ten
          verses are a strongly worded denunciation of the misgovernment to
          which the people of Jehovah had been subjected in the past. The
          prophet goes straight to the root of the evil when he indignantly
          asks, <span class="tei tei-q">“Should not the shepherds feed the
          flock?”</span> (ver. 2). The first principle of all true government
          is that it must <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page310">[pg
          310]</span><a name="Pg310" id="Pg310" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          be in the interest of the governed. But the universal vice of
          Oriental despotism, as we see in the case of the Turkish empire at
          the present day, or Egypt before the English occupation, is that
          the rulers rule for their own advantage, and treat the people as
          their lawful spoil. So it had been in Israel: the shepherds had fed
          themselves, and not the flock. Instead of carefully tending the
          sick and the maimed, and searching out the strayed and the lost,
          they had been concerned only to eat the milk<a id="noteref_134"
          name="noteref_134" href="#note_134"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">134</span></span></a> and
          clothe themselves with the wool and slaughter the fat; they had
          ruled with <span class="tei tei-q">“violence and rigour.”</span>
          That is to say, instead of healing the sores of the body politic,
          they had sought to enrich themselves at the expense of the people.
          Such misconduct in the name of government always brings its own
          penalty; it kills the goose that lays the golden eggs. The flock
          which is spoiled by its own shepherds is scattered on the mountains
          and becomes the prey of wild beasts; and so the nation that is
          weakened by internal misrule loses its powers of defence and
          succumbs to the attacks of some foreign invader. But the shepherds
          of Israel have to reckon with Him who is the owner of the flock,
          whose affection still watches over them, and whose compassion is
          stirred by the hapless condition of His people. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Therefore, O ye shepherds, hear the word of Jehovah;
          ... Behold, I am against the shepherds; and I will require My flock
          at their hand; and I will make them to cease from feeding [My]
          flock, that they who feed themselves may no longer shepherd them;
          and I will deliver My flock from their mouth, that they be not food
          for them”</span> (vv. 9, 10).</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">ii. But Jehovah
          not only removes the unworthy shepherds; He Himself takes on Him
          the office of shepherd to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page311">[pg
          311]</span><a name="Pg311" id="Pg311" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          the flock that has been so mishandled (vv. 11-16). As the shepherd
          goes out after the thunderstorm to call in his frightened sheep, so
          will Jehovah after the storm of judgment is over go forth to
          <span class="tei tei-q">“gather together the outcasts of
          Israel”</span> (Psalm cxlvii. 2). He will seek them out and deliver
          them from all places whither they were scattered in the day of
          clouds and darkness; then He will lead them back to the mountain
          height of Israel, where they shall enjoy abundant prosperity and
          security under His just and beneficent rule. By what agencies this
          deliverance is to be accomplished is nowhere indicated. It is the
          unanimous teaching of the prophets that the final salvation of
          Israel will be effected in a <span class="tei tei-q">“day of
          Jehovah”</span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, a day in which Jehovah's
          own power will be specially manifested. Hence there is no need to
          describe the process by which the Almighty works out His purpose of
          salvation; it is indescribable: the results are certain, but the
          intermediate agencies are supernatural, and the precise method of
          Jehovah's intervention is as a rule left indefinite. It is
          particularly to be noted that the Messiah plays no part in the
          actual work of deliverance. He is not the hero of a national
          struggle for independence, but comes on the scene and assumes the
          reins of government after Jehovah has gotten the victory and
          restored peace to Israel.<a id="noteref_135" name="noteref_135"
          href="#note_135"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">135</span></span></a></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">iii. The next
          six verses (17-22) add a feature to the allegory which is not found
          in the corresponding passage in Jeremiah. Jehovah will judge
          between one sheep and another, especially between the rams and
          he-goats on the one hand and the weaker animals on the other. The
          strong cattle had monopolised the fat meadows and clear
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page312">[pg 312]</span><a name=
          "Pg312" id="Pg312" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> settled waters, and
          as if this were not enough, they had trampled down the residue of
          the pastures and fouled the waters with their feet. Those addressed
          are the wealthy and powerful upper class, whose luxury and wanton
          extravagance had consumed the resources of the country, and left no
          sustenance for the poorer members of the community. Allusions to
          this kind of selfish tyranny are frequent in the older prophets.
          Amos speaks of the nobles as panting after the dust on the head of
          the poor, and of the luxurious dames of Samaria as oppressing the
          poor and crushing the needy, and saying to their lords,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Bring us to drink”</span> (Amos ii. 7, iv.
          1). Micah says of the same class in the southern kingdom that they
          cast out the women of Jehovah's people from their pleasant houses,
          and robbed their children of His glory for ever (Micah ii. 9). And
          Isaiah, to take one other example, denounces those who <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“take away the right from the poor of My people, that
          widows may be their prey, and that they may rob the orphans”</span>
          (Isa. x. 2). Under the corrupt administration of justice which the
          kings had tolerated for their own convenience litigation had been a
          farce; the rich man had always the ear of the judge, and the poor
          found no redress. But in Israel the true fountain of justice could
          not be polluted; it was only its channels that were obstructed. For
          Jehovah Himself was the supreme judge of His people; and in the
          restored commonwealth to which Ezekiel looks forward all civil
          relations will be regulated by a regard to His righteous will. He
          will <span class="tei tei-q">“save His flock that they be no more a
          prey, and will judge between cattle and cattle.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">iv. Then follows
          in the last section (vv. 23-31) the promise of the Messianic king,
          and a description of the blessings that accompany his reign:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I will set up one shepherd over them, and
          he shall feed them—My servant David: he shall feed them, and he
          shall be their shepherd. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page313">[pg
          313]</span><a name="Pg313" id="Pg313" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          And I Jehovah will be their God, and My servant David shall be a
          prince in their midst: I Jehovah have spoken it.”</span> There are
          one or two difficulties connected with the interpretation of this
          passage, the consideration of which may be postponed till we have
          finished our analysis of the chapter. It is sufficient in the
          meantime to notice that a Davidic kingdom in some sense is to be
          the foundation of social order in the new Israel. A prince will
          arise, endowed with the spirit of his exalted office, to discharge
          perfectly the royal functions in which the former kings had so
          lamentably failed. Through him the divine government of Israel will
          become a reality in the national life. The Godhead of Jehovah and
          the kingship of the Messiah will be inseparably associated in the
          faith of the people: <span class="tei tei-q">“Jehovah their God,
          and David their king”</span> (Hosea iii. 5) is the expression of
          the ground of Israel's confidence in the latter days. And this
          kingdom is the pledge of the fulness of divine blessing descending
          on the land and the people. The people shall dwell in safety, none
          making them afraid, because of the covenant of peace which Jehovah
          will make for them, securing them against the assaults of other
          nations.<a id="noteref_136" name="noteref_136" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have now
          before us the salient features of the Messianic hope, as it is
          presented in the pages of Ezekiel. We see that the idea is
          developed in contrast with the abuses that had characterised the
          historic monarchy in Israel. It represents the ideal of the kingdom
          as it exists in the mind of Jehovah, an ideal which no actual king
          had fully realised, and which most of them had shamefully violated.
          The Messiah is the vicegerent of Jehovah on earth, and the
          representative of His kingly authority and righteous government
          over Israel. We see further that the promise is based on the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“sure mercies of David,”</span> the
          covenant which secured the throne to David's descendants for ever.
          Messianic prophecy is legitimist, the ideal king being regarded as
          standing in the direct line of succession to the crown. And to
          these features we may add another, which is explicitly developed in
          ch. xxxvii. 22-26, although it is implied in the expression
          <span class="tei tei-q">“one shepherd”</span> in the passage with
          which we have been dealing. The Messianic kingdom represents the
          unity of all Israel, and particularly the reunion of the two
          kingdoms under one sceptre. The prophets attach great importance to
          this idea.<a id="noteref_139" name="noteref_139" href=
          "#note_139"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">139</span></span></a> The
          existence of two rival monarchies, divided in interest and often at
          war with each other, although it had never effaced the
          consciousness of the original unity of the nation, was felt by the
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page315">[pg 315]</span><a name=
          "Pg315" id="Pg315" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> prophets to be an
          anomalous state of things, and seriously detrimental to the
          national religion. The ideal relation of Jehovah to Israel was as
          incompatible with two kingdoms as the ideal of marriage is
          incompatible with two wives to one husband. Hence in the glorious
          future of the Messianic age the schism must be healed, and the
          Davidic dynasty restored to its original position at the head of an
          undivided empire. The prominence given to this thought in the
          teaching of Hosea shows that even in the northern kingdom devout
          Israelites cherished the hope of reunion with their brethren under
          the house of David as the only form in which the redemption of the
          nation could be achieved. And although, long before Ezekiel's day,
          the kingdom of Samaria had disappeared from history, he too looks
          forward to a restoration of the ten tribes as an essential element
          of the Messianic salvation.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In these
          respects the teaching of Ezekiel reflects the general tenor of the
          Messianic prophecy of the Old Testament. There are just two
          questions on which some obscurity and uncertainty must be felt to
          rest. In the first place, what is the precise meaning of the
          expression <span class="tei tei-q">“My servant David”</span>? It
          will not be supposed that the prophet expected David, the founder
          of the Hebrew monarchy, to reappear in person and inaugurate the
          new dispensation. Such an interpretation would be utterly false to
          Eastern modes of thought and expression, besides being opposed to
          every indication we have of the prophetic conception of the
          Messiah. Even in popular language the name of David was current,
          after he had been long dead, as the name of the dynasty which he
          had founded. When the ten tribes revolted from Rehoboam they said,
          exactly as they had said in David's lifetime, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“What portion have we in David? neither have we
          inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents, O Israel:
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page316">[pg 316]</span><a name=
          "Pg316" id="Pg316" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> now see to thine own
          house, David.”</span><a id="noteref_140" name="noteref_140" href=
          "#note_140"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">140</span></span></a> If
          the name of David could thus be invoked in popular speech at a time
          of great political excitement, we need not be surprised to find it
          used in a similar sense in the figurative style of the prophets.
          All that the word means is that the Messiah will be one who comes
          in the spirit and power of David, a representative of the ancient
          family who carries to completion the work so nobly begun by his
          great ancestor.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The real
          difficulty is whether the title <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“David”</span> denotes a unique individual or a line of
          Davidic kings. To that question it is hardly possible to return a
          decided answer. That the idea of a succession of sovereigns is a
          possible form of the Messianic hope is shown by a passage in the
          thirty-third chapter of Jeremiah. There the promise of the
          righteous sprout of the house of David is supplemented by the
          assurance that David shall never want a man to sit on the throne of
          Israel;<a id="noteref_141" name="noteref_141" href=
          "#note_141"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">141</span></span></a> the
          allusion therefore appears to be to the dynasty, and not to a
          single person. And this view finds some support in the case of
          Ezekiel from the fact that in the later vision of chs. xl.-xlviii.
          the prophet undoubtedly anticipates a perpetuation of the dynasty
          through successive generations.<a id="noteref_142" name=
          "noteref_142" href="#note_142"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">142</span></span></a> On
          the other hand it is difficult to reconcile this view with the
          expressions used in this and the thirty-seventh chapters. When we
          read that <span class="tei tei-q">“My servant David shall be their
          prince for ever,”</span><a id="noteref_143" name="noteref_143"
          href="#note_143"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">143</span></span></a> we
          can scarcely escape the impression that the prophet is thinking of
          a personal Messiah reigning eternally. If it were necessary to
          decide between these <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page317">[pg
          317]</span><a name="Pg317" id="Pg317" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          two alternatives, it might be safest to adhere to the idea of a
          personal Messiah, as conveying the fullest rendering of the
          prophet's thought. There is reason to think that in the interval
          between this prophecy and his final vision Ezekiel's conception of
          the Messiah underwent a certain modification, and therefore the
          teaching of the later passage cannot be used to control the
          explanation of this. But the obscurity is of such a nature that we
          cannot hope to remove it. In the prophets' delineations of the
          future there are many points on which the light of revelation had
          not been fully cast; for they, like the Christian apostle,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“knew in part and prophesied in
          part.”</span> And the question of the way in which the Messiah's
          office is to be prolonged is precisely one of those which did not
          greatly occupy the mind of the prophets. There is no perspective in
          Messianic prophecy: the future kingdom of God is seen, as it were,
          in one plane, and how it is to be transmitted from one age to
          another is never thought of. Thus it may become difficult to say
          whether a particular prophet, in speaking of the Messiah, has a
          single individual in view or whether he is thinking of a dynasty or
          a succession. To Ezekiel the Messiah was a divinely revealed ideal,
          which was to be fulfilled in a person; whether the prophet himself
          distinctly understood this is a matter of inferior importance.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The second
          question is one that perhaps would not readily occur to a plain
          man. It relates to the meaning of the word <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“prince”</span> as applied to the Messiah. It has been
          thought by some critics that Ezekiel had a special reason for
          avoiding the title <span class="tei tei-q">“king”</span>; and from
          this supposed reason a somewhat sweeping conclusion has been
          deduced. We are asked to believe that Ezekiel had in principle
          abandoned the Messianic hope of his earlier prophecies—<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          the hope of a restoration of the Davidic kingdom in its ancient
          splendour. What he really contemplates is <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page318">[pg 318]</span><a name="Pg318" id="Pg318" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> the abolition of the Hebrew monarchy, and the
          institution of a new political system entirely different from
          anything that had existed in the past. Although the Davidic prince
          will hold the first place in the restored community, his dignity
          will be less than royal; he will only be a titular monarch, his
          power being overshadowed by the presence of Jehovah, the true king
          of Israel. Now so far as this view is suggested by the use of the
          word <span class="tei tei-q">“prince”</span> (literally
          <span class="tei tei-q">“leader”</span> or <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“president”</span>) in preference to <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“king,”</span><a id="noteref_144" name="noteref_144"
          href="#note_144"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">144</span></span></a> it is
          sufficiently answered by pointing to the Messianic passage in ch.
          xxxvii., where the name <span class="tei tei-q">“king”</span> is
          used three times and in a peculiarly emphatic manner of the
          Messianic prince.<a id="noteref_145" name="noteref_145" href=
          "#note_145"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">145</span></span></a> There
          is no reason to suppose that Ezekiel drew a distinction between
          <span class="tei tei-q">“princely”</span> and <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“kingly”</span> rank, and deliberately withheld the
          higher dignity from the Messiah. Whatever may be the exact relation
          of the Messiah to Jehovah, there is no doubt that he is conceived
          as a king in the full sense of the term, possessed of all regal
          qualities, and shepherding his people with the authority which
          belonged to a true son of David.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But there is
          another consideration which weighs more seriously with the writers
          referred to. There is reason to believe that Ezekiel's conception
          of the final kingdom of God underwent a change which might not
          unfairly be described as an abandonment of the Messianic
          expectation in its more restricted sense. In his latest vision the
          functions of the prince are defined in such a way that his position
          is shorn of the ideal significance which properly invests the
          office of the Messiah. The change does not indeed <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page319">[pg 319]</span><a name="Pg319" id="Pg319"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> affect his merely political status. He
          is still son of David and king of Israel, and all that is here said
          about his duty towards his subjects is there presupposed. But his
          character seems to be no longer regarded as thoroughly reliable, or
          equal to all the temptations that arise wherever absolute power is
          lodged in human hands. The possibility that the king may abuse his
          authority for his private advantage is distinctly contemplated, and
          provision is made against it in the statutory constitution to which
          the king himself is subject. Such precautions are obviously
          inconsistent with the ideal of the Messianic kingdom which we find,
          for example, in the prophecy of Isaiah. The important question
          therefore comes to be, whether this lower view of the monarchy is
          anticipated in the thirty-fourth and thirty-seventh chapters. This
          does not appear to be the case. The prophet still occupies the same
          standpoint as in ch. xvii., regarding the Davidic monarchy as the
          central religious institution of the restored state. The Messiah of
          these chapters is a perfect king, endowed with the Spirit of God
          for the discharge of his great office, one whose personal character
          affords an absolute security for the maintenance of public
          righteousness, and who is the medium of communication between God
          and the nation. In other words, what we have to do with is a
          Messianic prediction in the fullest sense of the term.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In concluding
          our study of Ezekiel's Messianic teaching, we may make one remark
          bearing on its typological interpretation. The attempt is sometimes
          made to trace a gradual development and enrichment of the Messianic
          idea in the hands of successive prophets. From that point of view
          Ezekiel's contribution to the doctrine of the Messiah must be felt
          to be disappointing. No one can imagine that his portrait of the
          coming king possesses anything like the suggestiveness and
          religious <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page320">[pg
          320]</span><a name="Pg320" id="Pg320" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          meaning conveyed by the ideal which stands out so clearly from the
          pages of Isaiah. And, indeed, no subsequent prophet excels or even
          equals Isaiah in the clearness and profundity of his directly
          Messianic conceptions. This fact shows us that the endeavour to
          find in the Old Testament a regular progress along one particular
          line proceeds on too narrow a view of the scope of prophecy. The
          truth is that the figure of the king is only one of many types of
          the Christian dispensation which the religious institutions of
          Israel supplied to the prophets. It is the most perfect of all
          types, partly because it is personal, and partly because the idea
          of kingship is the most comprehensive of the offices which Christ
          executes as our Redeemer. But, after all, it expresses only one
          aspect of the glorious future of the kingdom of God towards which
          prophecy steadily points. We must remember also that the order in
          which these types emerge is determined not altogether by their
          intrinsic importance, but partly by their adaptation to the needs
          of the age in which the prophet lived. The main function of
          prophecy was to furnish present and practical direction to the
          people of God; and the form under which the ideal was presented to
          any particular generation was always that best fitted to help it
          onwards, one stage nearer to the great consummation. Thus while
          Isaiah idealises the figure of the king, Jeremiah grasps the
          conception of a new religion under the form of a covenant, the
          second Isaiah unfolds the idea of the prophetic servant of Jehovah,
          Zechariah and the writer of the 110th Psalm idealise the
          priesthood. All these are Messianic prophecies, if we take the word
          in its widest acceptation; but they are not all cast in one mould,
          and the attempt to arrange them in a single series is obviously
          misleading. So with regard to Ezekiel we may say that his chief
          Messianic ideal (still using the expression in a general sense) is
          the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page321">[pg 321]</span><a name=
          "Pg321" id="Pg321" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> sanctuary, the
          symbol of Jehovah's presence in the midst of His people. At the end
          of ch. xxxvii. the kingdom and the sanctuary are mentioned together
          as pledges of the glory of the latter days. But while the idea of
          the Messianic monarchy was a legacy inherited from his prophetic
          precursors, the Temple was an institution whose typical
          significance Ezekiel was the first to unfold. It was moreover the
          one that met the religious requirements of the age in which Ezekiel
          lived. Ultimately the hope of the personal Messiah loses the
          importance which it still has in the present section of the book;
          and the prophet's vision of the future concentrates itself on the
          sanctuary as the centre of the restored theocracy, and the source
          from which the regenerating influences of the divine grace flow
          forth to Israel and the world.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The teaching of
          this important passage turns on certain ideas regarding the land of
          Canaan which enter very deeply into the religion of Israel. These
          ideas are no doubt familiar in a general way to all thoughtful
          readers of the Old Testament; but their full import is scarcely
          realised until we understand that they are not peculiar to the
          Bible, but form part of the stock of religious conceptions common
          to Israel and its heathen neighbours.<a id="noteref_146" name=
          "noteref_146" href="#note_146"><span class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">146</span></span></a> In
          the more advanced Semitic religions of antiquity each nation had
          its own god as well as its own land, and the bond between the god
          and the land was supposed to be quite as strong as that between the
          god and the nation. The god, the land, and the people formed a
          triad of religious relationship, and so closely were these three
          elements associated that the expulsion of a people from its land
          was held to dissolve the bond between it and the god. Thus while in
          practice the land of a god was coextensive with the territory
          inhabited by his worshippers, yet in theory the relation of the god
          to his land is independent of his relation to the inhabitants; it
          was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">his</span></em> land whether the people in it
          were his worshippers or not. The peculiar confusion of ideas that
          arose when the people <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page323">[pg
          323]</span><a name="Pg323" id="Pg323" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          of one god came to reside permanently in the territory of another
          is well illustrated by the case of the heathen colony which the
          king of Assyria planted in Samaria after the exile of the ten
          tribes. These settlers brought their own gods with them; but when
          some of them were slain by lions, they perceived that they were
          making a mistake in ignoring the rights of the god of the land.
          They sent accordingly for a priest to instruct them in the religion
          of the god of the land; and the result was that they <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“feared Jehovah and served their own gods”</span> (2
          Kings xvii. 24-41). It was expected no doubt that in course of time
          the foreign deities would be acclimatised.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the Old
          Testament we find many traces of the influence of this conception
          on the Hebrew religion. Canaan was the land of Jehovah (Hosea ix.
          3) apart altogether from its possession by Israel, the people of
          Jehovah. It was Jehovah's land before Israel entered it, the
          inheritance which He had selected for His people out of all the
          countries of the world, the Land of Promise, given to the
          patriarchs while as yet they were but strangers and sojourners in
          it. Although the Israelites took possession of it as a nation of
          conquerors, they did so in the consciousness that they were
          expelling from Jehovah's dwelling-place a population which had
          polluted it by their abominations. From that time onwards the
          tenure of the soil of Palestine was regarded as an essential factor
          of the national religion. The idea that Jehovah could not be
          rightly worshipped outside of Hebrew territory was firmly rooted in
          the mind of the people, and was accepted by the prophets as a
          principle involved in the special relations that Jehovah maintained
          with the people of Israel.<a id="noteref_147" name="noteref_147"
          href="#note_147"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">147</span></span></a> Hence
          no threat could be more terrible in the ears of the Israelites than
          that of expatriation from <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page324">[pg
          324]</span><a name="Pg324" id="Pg324" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          their native soil; for it meant nothing less than the dissolution
          of the tie that subsisted between them and their God. When that
          threat was actually fulfilled there was no reproach harder to bear
          than the taunt which Ezekiel here puts into the mouth of the
          heathen: <span class="tei tei-q">“These are Jehovah's people—and
          yet they are gone forth out of His land”</span> (ch. xxxvi. 20).
          They felt all that was implied in that utterance of malicious
          satisfaction over the collapse of a religion and the downfall of a
          deity.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is another
          way in which the thought of Canaan as Jehovah's land enters into
          the religious conceptions of the Old Testament, and very markedly
          into those of Ezekiel. As the God of the land Jehovah is the source
          of its productiveness and the author of all the natural blessings
          enjoyed by its inhabitants. It is He who gives the rain in its
          season or else withholds it in token of His displeasure; it is He
          who multiplies or diminishes the flocks and herds which feed on its
          pastures, as well as the human population sustained by its produce.
          This view of things was a primary factor in the religious education
          of an agricultural people, as the ancient Hebrews mainly were. They
          felt their dependence on God most directly in the influences of
          their uncertain climate on the fertility of their land, with its
          great possibilities of abundant provision for man and beast, and on
          the other hand its extreme risk of famine and all the hardships
          that follow in its train. In the changeful aspects of nature they
          thus read instinctively the disposition of Jehovah towards
          themselves. Fruitful seasons and golden harvests, diffusing comfort
          and affluence through the community, were regarded as proofs that
          all was well between them and their God; while times of barrenness
          and scarcity brought home to them the conviction that Jehovah was
          alienated. From the allusions in the prophets to droughts and
          famines, to blastings and mildew, to <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page325">[pg 325]</span><a name="Pg325" id="Pg325" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> the scourge of locusts, we seem to gather
          that on the whole the later history of Israel had been marked by
          agricultural distress. The impression is confirmed by a hint of
          Ezekiel's in the passage now before us. The land of Canaan had
          apparently acquired an unenviable reputation for barrenness. The
          reproach of the heathen lay upon it as a land that <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“devoured men and bereaved its
          population.”</span><a id="noteref_148" name="noteref_148" href=
          "#note_148"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">148</span></span></a> The
          reference may be partly (as Smend thinks) to the ravages of war, to
          which Palestine was peculiarly exposed on account of its important
          strategic situation. But the <span class="tei tei-q">“reproach of
          famine”</span><a id="noteref_149" name="noteref_149" href=
          "#note_149"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">149</span></span></a> was
          certainly one point in its ill fame among the surrounding nations,
          and it is quite sufficient to explain the strong language in which
          they expressed their contempt. Now this state of things was plainly
          inconsistent with amicable relations between the nation and its
          God. It was evidence that the land lay under the blight of
          Jehovah's displeasure, and the ground of that displeasure lay in
          the sin of the people. Where the land counted for so much as an
          index to the mind of God, it was a postulate of faith that in the
          ideal future when God and Israel were perfectly reconciled the
          physical condition of Canaan should be worthy of Him whose land it
          was. And we have already seen that amongst the glories of the
          Messianic age the preternatural fertility of the Holy Land holds a
          prominent place.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This conception
          of Canaan as the land of Jehovah undoubtedly has its natural
          affinities with religious notions of a somewhat primitive kind. It
          belongs to the stage of thought at which the power of a god is
          habitually regarded as subject to local limitations, and in which
          accordingly a particular territory is assigned to every deity as
          the sphere of his influence. It is probable that the great mass of
          the Hebrew people had never risen above this idea, but continued to
          think of their country as Jehovah's land in <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page326">[pg 326]</span><a name="Pg326" id="Pg326"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> precisely the same way as Assyria was
          Asshur's land and Moab the land of Chemosh. The monotheism of the
          Old Testament revelation breaks through this system of ideas, and
          interprets Jehovah's relation to the land in an entirely different
          sense. It is not as the exclusive sphere of His influence that
          Canaan is peculiarly associated with Jehovah's presence, but mainly
          because it is the scene of His historical manifestation of Himself,
          and the stage on which events were transacted which revealed His
          Godhead to all the world. No prophet has a clearer perception of
          the universal sweep of the divine government than Ezekiel, and yet
          no prophet insists more strongly than he on the possession of the
          land of Canaan as an indispensable symbol of communion between God
          and His people. He has met with God in the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“unclean land”</span> of his exile, and he knows that
          the moral government of the universe is not suspended by the
          departure of Jehovah from His earthly sanctuary. Nevertheless he
          cannot think of this separation as other than temporary. The final
          reconciliation must take place on the soil of Palestine. The
          kingdom of God can only be established by the return both of Israel
          and Jehovah to their own land; and their joint possession of that
          land is the seal of the everlasting covenant of peace that subsists
          between them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We must now
          proceed to study the way in which these conceptions influenced the
          Messianic expectations of Ezekiel at this period of his life. The
          passage we are to consider consists of three sections. The
          thirty-fifth chapter is a prophecy of judgment on Edom. The first
          fifteen verses of ch. xxxvi. contain a promise of the restoration
          of the land of Israel to its rightful owner. And the remainder of
          that chapter presents a comprehensive view of the divine necessity
          for the restoration and the power by which the redemption of the
          people is to be accomplished.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page327">[pg 327]</span><a name="Pg327" id="Pg327" class=

          <div class="tei tei-div" style=
          "margin-top: 3.00em; margin-bottom: 3.00em">
            <h3 class="tei tei-head" style=
            "text-align: left; margin-top: 2.40em; margin-bottom: 2.40em">
            <span style="font-size: 120%">I</span></h3>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the time
            when these prophecies were written the land of Israel was in the
            possession of the Edomites. By what means they had succeeded in
            effecting a lodgment in the country we do not know. It is not
            unlikely that Nebuchadnezzar may have granted them this extension
            of their territory as a reward for their services to his army
            during the last siege of Jerusalem. At all events their presence
            there was an accomplished fact, and it appeals to the mind of the
            prophet in two aspects. In the first place it was an outrage on
            the majesty of Jehovah which filled the cup of Edom's iniquity to
            the brim. In the second place it was an obstacle to the
            restoration of Israel which had to be removed by the direct
            intervention of the Almighty. These are the two themes which
            occupy the thoughts of Ezekiel, the one in ch. xxxv. and the
            other in ch. xxxvi. Hitherto he has spoken of the return to the
            land of Canaan as a matter of course, as a thing necessary and
            self-evident and not needing to be discussed in detail. But as
            the time draws near he is led to think more clearly of the
            historical circumstances of the return, and especially of the
            hindrances arising from the actual situation of affairs.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But besides
            this one cannot fail to be struck by the effective contrast which
            the two pictures—one of the mountain land of Israel, and the
            other of the mountain land of Seir—present to the imagination. It
            is like a prophetic amplification of the blessing and curse which
            Isaac pronounced on the progenitors of these two nations. Of the
            one it is said:—</p>

            forecast of the destiny of the two brothers the actual
            characteristics of their respective countries are tersely and
            accurately expressed. But now, when the history of both nations
            is about to be brought to an issue, the contrast is emphasised
            and perpetuated. The blessing of Jacob is confirmed and expanded
            into a promise of unimagined felicity, and the equivocal blessing
            on Esau is changed into an unqualified and permanent curse. Thus,
            when the mountains of Israel break forth into singing, and are
            clothed with all the luxuriance of vegetation in which the
            Oriental imagination revels, and cultivated by a happy and
            contented people, those of Seir are doomed to perpetual sterility
            and become a horror and desolation to all that pass by.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Confining
            ourselves, however, to the thirty-fifth chapter, what we have
            first to notice is the sins by which the Edomites had incurred
            this judgment. These may be summed up under three heads: first,
            their unrelenting hatred of Israel, which in the day of Judah's
            calamity had broken out in savage acts of revenge (ver. 5);
            second, their rejoicing over the misfortunes of Israel and the
            desolation of its land (ver. 15); and third, their eagerness to
            seize the land as soon as it was vacant (ver. 10). The first and
            second of these have been already spoken of under the prophecies
            on foreign nations; it is only the last that is of special
            interest in the present connection. Of course the motive that
            prompted Edom was natural, and it may be difficult to say how far
            real moral guilt was involved in it. The annexation of vacant
            territory, as the land of Israel practically was at this time,
            would <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page329">[pg
            329]</span><a name="Pg329" id="Pg329" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            be regarded according to modern ideas as not only justifiable but
            praiseworthy. Edom had the excuse of seeking to better its
            condition by the possession of a more fertile country than its
            own, and perhaps also the still stronger plea of pressure by the
            Arabs from behind. But in the consciousness of an ancient people
            there was always another thought present; and it is here if
            anywhere that the sin of Edom lies. The invasion of Israel did
            not cease to be an act of aggression because there were no human
            defenders to bar the way. It was still Jehovah's land, although
            it was unoccupied; and to intrude upon it was a conscious
            defiance of His power. The arguments by which the Edomites
            justified their seizure of it were none of those which a modern
            state might use in similar circumstances, but were based on the
            religious ideas which were common to all the world in those days.
            They were aware that by the unwritten law which then prevailed
            the step they meditated was sacrilege; and the spirit that
            animated them was arrogant exultation over what was esteemed the
            humiliation of Israel's national deity: <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“The two nations and the two countries shall be mine,
            and I will possess them, although Jehovah was there”</span> (ver.
            10: cf. vv. 12, 13). That is to say, the defeat and captivity of
            Israel have proved the impotence of Jehovah to guard His land;
            His power is broken, and the two countries called by His name lie
            open to the invasion of any people that dares to trample
            religious scruples underfoot. This was the way in which the
            action of Edom would be interpreted by universal consent; and the
            prophet is only reflecting the general sense of the age when he
            charges them with this impiety. Now it is true that the Edomites
            could not be expected to understand all that was involved in a
            defiance of the God of Israel. To them He was only one among many
            national gods, and their religion did not teach them to reverence
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page330">[pg 330]</span><a name=
            "Pg330" id="Pg330" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the gods of a
            foreign state. But though they were not fully conscious of the
            degree of guilt they incurred, they nevertheless sinned against
            the light they had; and the consequences of transgression are
            never measured by the sinner's own estimate of his culpability.
            There was enough in the history of Israel to have impressed the
            neighbouring peoples with a sense of the superiority of its
            religion and the difference in character between Jehovah and all
            other gods. If the Edomites had utterly failed to learn that
            lesson, they were themselves partly to blame; and the spiritual
            insensibility and dulness of conscience which everywhere
            suppressed the knowledge of Jehovah's name is the very thing
            which in the view of Ezekiel needs to be removed by signal and
            exemplary acts of judgment.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is not
            necessary to enter minutely into the details of the judgment
            threatened against Edom. We may simply note that it corresponds
            point for point with the demeanour exhibited by the Edomites in
            the time of Israel's final retribution. The <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“perpetual hatred”</span> is rewarded by perpetual
            desolation (ver. 9); their seizure of Jehovah's land is punished
            by their annihilation in the land that was their own (vv. 6-8);
            and their malicious satisfaction over the depopulation of
            Palestine recoils on their own heads when their mountain land is
            made desolate <span class="tei tei-q">“to the rejoicing of the
            whole earth”</span> (vv. 14, 15). And the lesson that will be
            taught to the world by the contrast between the renewed Israel
            and the barren mountain of Seir will be the power and holiness of
            the one true God: <span class="tei tei-q">“they shall know that I
            am Jehovah.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The prophet's
            mind is still occupied with the sin of Edom as he turns in the
            thirty-sixth chapter to depict <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page331">[pg 331]</span><a name="Pg331" id="Pg331" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> the future of the land of Israel. The
            opening verses of the chapter (vv. 1-7) betray an intensity of
            patriotic feeling not often expressed by Ezekiel. The utterance
            of the single idea which he wishes to express seems to be impeded
            by the multitude of reflections that throng upon him as he
            apostrophises <span class="tei tei-q">“the mountains and the
            hills, the watercourses and the valleys, the desolate ruins and
            deserted cities”</span> of his native country (ver. 4). The land
            is conceived as conscious of the shame and reproach that rest
            upon it; and all the elements that might be supposed to make up
            the consciousness of the land—its naked desolation, the tread of
            alien feet, the ravages of war, and the derisive talk of the
            surrounding heathen (Edom being specially in view)—present
            themselves to the mind of the prophet before he can utter the
            message with which he is charged: <span class="tei tei-q">“Thus
            saith the Lord Jehovah; Behold, I speak in My jealousy and My
            anger, because ye have borne the shame of the heathen: therefore
            ... I lift up My hand, Surely the nations that are round about
            you—even they shall bear their shame”</span> (vv. 6, 7).</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The jealousy
            of Jehovah is here His holy resentment against indignities done
            to Himself, and this attribute of the divine nature is now
            enlisted on the side of Israel because of the despite which the
            heathen had heaped on His land. But it is noteworthy that it is
            through the land and not the people that this feeling is first
            called into operation. Israel is still sinful and alienated from
            God; but the honour of Jehovah is bound up with the land not less
            than with the nation, and it is in reference to it that the
            necessity of vindicating His holy name first becomes apparent.
            There is what we might almost venture to call a divine
            patriotism, which is stirred into activity by the desolate
            condition of the land where the worship of the true God should be
            celebrated. On this feature of Jehovah's character Ezekiel builds
            the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page332">[pg 332]</span><a name=
            "Pg332" id="Pg332" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> assurance of his
            people's redemption. The idea expressed by the verses is simply
            the certainty that Canaan shall be recovered from the heathen
            dominion for the purposes of the kingdom of God.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The following
            verses (8-15) speak of the positive aspects of the approaching
            deliverance. Continuing his apostrophe to the mountains of
            Israel, the prophet describes the transformation which is to pass
            over them in view of the return of the exiled nation, which is
            now on the eve of accomplishment (ver. 8). It might almost seem
            as if the return of the inhabitants were here treated as a mere
            incident of the rehabilitation of the land. That of course is
            only an appearance, caused by the peculiar standpoint assumed
            throughout these chapters. Ezekiel was not one who could look on
            complacently</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">nor was he
            indifferent to the social welfare of his people. On the contrary
            we have seen from ch. xxxiv. that he regards that as a supreme
            interest in the future kingdom of God. And even in this passage
            he does not make the interests of humanity subservient to those
            of nature. His leading idea is a reunion of land and people under
            happier auspices than had obtained of old. Formerly the land, in
            mysterious sympathy with the mind of Jehovah, had seemed to be
            animated by a hostile disposition towards its inhabitants. The
            reluctant and niggardly subsistence that had been wrung from the
            soil justified the evil report which the spies had brought up of
            it at the first as a <span class="tei tei-q">“land that eateth up

            inhospitable character was known among the heathen, so that it
            bore the reproach of being a land that <span class=

            the glorious future all <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page333">[pg

            this will be changed in harmony with Jehovah's altered relations
            with His people. In the language of a later prophet,<a id=

            Jehovah, and endowed with exuberant fertility. Yielding its
            fruits freely and generously, it will wipe off the reproach of
            the heathen; its cities shall be inhabited, its ruins rebuilt,
            and man and beast multiplied on its surface, so that its last
            state shall be better than its first (ver. 11). And those who
            till it and enjoy the benefits of its wonderful transformation
            shall be none other than the house of Israel, for whose sins it
            had borne the reproach of barrenness in the past (vv. 12-15).</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next
            passage (vv. 16-38) deals more with the renewal of the nation
            than with that of the land; and thus forms a link of connection
            between the main theme of this chapter and that of ch. xxxvii. It
            contains the clearest and most comprehensive statement of the
            process of redemption to be found in the whole book, exhibiting
            as it does in logical order all the elements which enter into the
            divine scheme of salvation. The fact that it is inserted just at
            this point affords a fresh illustration of the importance
            attached by the prophet to the religious associations which
            gathered round the Holy Land. The land indeed is still the pivot
            on which his thoughts turn; he starts from it in his short review
            of God's past judgments on His people, and finally returns to it
            in summing up the world-wide effects of His gracious dealings
            with them in the immediate future. Although the connection of
            ideas is singularly clear, the passage throws so much light on
            the deepest theological conceptions of Ezekiel that it will be
            well to recapitulate the principal steps of the
            argument.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page334">[pg
            334]</span><a name="Pg334" id="Pg334" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We need not
            linger on the cause of the rejection of Israel, for here the
            prophet only repeats the main lesson which we have found so often
            enforced in the first part of his book. Israel went into exile
            because its manner of life as a nation had been abhorrent to
            Jehovah, and it had defiled the land which was Jehovah's house.
            As in ch. xxii. and elsewhere bloodshed and idols are the chief
            emblems of the people's sinful condition; these constitute a real
            physical defilement of the land, which must be punished by the
            eviction of its inhabitants: <span class="tei tei-q">“So I poured
            out My wrath upon them [on account of the blood which they had
            shed upon the land, and the idols wherewith they had polluted
            it]: and I scattered them among the nations, and they were
            dispersed through the countries.”</span><a id="noteref_153" name=
            "noteref_153" href="#note_153"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">153</span></span></a></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus the Exile
            was necessary for the vindication of Jehovah's holiness as
            reflected in the sanctity of His land. But the effect of the
            dispersion on other nations was such as to compromise the honour
            of Israel's God in another direction. Knowing Jehovah only as a
            tribal god, the heathen naturally concluded that He had been too
            feeble to protect His land from invasion and His people from
            captivity. They could not penetrate to the moral reasons which
            rendered the chastisement inevitable; they only saw that these
            were Jehovah's people, and yet they were gone forth out of His
            land (ver. 20), and drew the natural inference. The impression
            thus produced by the presence of Israelites amongst the heathen
            was derogatory to the majesty of Jehovah, and obscured the
            knowledge of the true principles of His government which was
            destined to extend to all the earth. This is all that seems to be
            meant by the expression <span class="tei tei-q">“profaned My holy
            name.”</span><a id="noteref_154" name="noteref_154" href=
            "#note_154"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

            "Pg335" id="Pg335" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> It is not implied
            that the exiles scandalised the heathen by their vicious lives,
            and so brought disgrace on <span class="tei tei-q">“that glorious
            name by which they were called,”</span><a id="noteref_155" name=
            "noteref_155" href="#note_155"><span class=

            although that idea is implied in ch. xii. 16. The profanation
            spoken of here was caused directly not by the sin but by the
            calamities of Israel. Yet it was their sins which brought down
            judgment upon them, and so indirectly gave occasion to the
            enemies of the Lord to blaspheme. There were probably already
            some of Ezekiel's compatriots who realised the bitterness of the
            thought that their fate was the means of bringing discredit on
            their God. Their experience would be similar to that of the
            lonely exile who composed the forty-second psalm:—</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now in this
            fact the prophet recognises an absolute ground of confidence in
            Israel's restoration. Jehovah cannot endure that His name should
            thus be held up to derision before the eyes of mankind. To allow
            this would be to frustrate the end of His government of the
            world, which is to manifest His Godhead in such a way that all
            men shall be brought to acknowledge it. Although He is known as
            yet only as the national God of a particular people, He must be
            disclosed to the world as all that the inspired teachers of
            Israel know Him to be—the one Being worthy of the homage of the
            human heart. There must be some way by which His name can be
            sanctified before the heathen, some means of reconciling the
            partial revelation of His holiness in Israel's dispersion with
            the complete manifestation of His power to the world at large.
            And this reconciliation can only be effected through the
            redemption of Israel. God cannot disown His ancient <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page336">[pg 336]</span><a name="Pg336" id=
            "Pg336" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> people, for that would be to
            stultify the whole past revelation of His character and leave the
            name by which He had made Himself known to contempt. That is
            divinely impossible; and therefore Jehovah must carry through His
            purpose by sanctifying Himself in the salvation of Israel. The
            outward token of salvation will be their restoration to their own
            land (ver. 24); but the inward reality of it will be a change in
            the national character which will make their dwelling in the land
            consistent with the revelation of Jehovah's holiness already
            given by their banishment from it.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At this point
            accordingly (ver. 25) Ezekiel passes to speak of the spiritual
            process of regeneration by which Israel is to be transformed into
            a true people of God. This is a necessary part of the
            sanctification of the divine name before the world. The new life
            of the people will reveal the character of the God whom they
            serve, and the change will explain the calamities that had
            befallen them in the past. The world will thus see <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“that the house of Israel went into captivity for
            their iniquity,”</span><a id="noteref_157" name="noteref_157"
            href="#note_157"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">157</span></span></a> and
            will understand the holiness which the true God requires in His
            worshippers. But for the present the prophet's thoughts are
            concentrated on the operations of the divine grace by which the
            renewal is effected. His analysis of the process of conversion is
            profoundly instructive, and anticipates to a remarkable degree
            the teaching of the New Testament. We shall content ourselves at
            present with merely enumerating the different parts of the
            process. The first step is the removal of the impurities
            contracted by past transgressions. This is represented under the
            figure of sprinkling with clean water, suggested by the ablutions
            or lustrations which are so common a feature of the Levitical
            ritual (ver. 25). <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page337">[pg
            337]</span><a name="Pg337" id="Pg337" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            The truth symbolised is the forgiveness of sins, the act of grace
            which takes away the effect of moral uncleanness as a barrier to
            fellowship with God. The second point is what is properly called
            regeneration, the giving of a new heart and spirit (ver. 26). The
            stony heart of the old nation, whose obduracy had dismayed so
            many prophets, making them feel that they had spent their labour
            for nought and in vain, shall be taken away, and instead of it
            they shall receive a heart of flesh, sensitive to spiritual
            influences and responsive to the divine will. And to this is
            added in the third place the promise of the Spirit of God to be
            in them as the ruling principle of a new life of obedience to the
            law of God (ver. 27). The law, both moral and ceremonial, is the
            expression of Jehovah's holy nature, and both the will and the
            power to keep it perfectly must proceed from the indwelling of
            His holy Spirit in the people.<a id="noteref_158" name=
            "noteref_158" href="#note_158"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

            is thus Jehovah Himself who <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“saves”</span> the people <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“out of all their uncleannesses”</span> (ver. 29),
            caused by the depravity and infirmity of their natural hearts.
            When these conditions are realised the harmony between Jehovah
            and Israel will be completely restored: He will be their God, and
            they shall be His people. They shall dwell for ever in the land
            promised to their fathers; and the blessing of God resting on
            land and people will multiply the fruit of the tree and the
            produce of the field, so that they receive no more the reproach
            of famine among the nations (vv. 28-30).</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Having thus
            described the process of salvation as from first to last the work
            of Jehovah, the prophet proceeds to consider the impression which
            it will produce first on Israel and then on the surrounding

            On Israel the effect of the goodness of God will be to lead them
            to repentance. Remembering what their past history has been, and
            contrasting it with the blessedness they now enjoy, they shall be
            filled with shame and self-contempt, loathing themselves for
            their iniquities and their abominations. It is not meant that all
            feelings of joy and gratitude will be swallowed up in the
            consciousness of unworthiness; but this is the feeling that will
            be called forth by the memory of their past transgressions. Their
            horror of sin will be such that they cannot think of what they
            have been without the deepest compunction and self-abasement. And
            this sense of the exceeding sinfulness of sin, reacting on their
            consciousness of themselves, will be the best moral guarantee
            against their relapse into the uncleanness from which they have
            been delivered.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To the
            heathen, on the other hand, the state of Israel will be a
            convincing demonstration of the power and godhead of Jehovah. Men
            will say, <span class="tei tei-q">“Yonder land, which was
            desolate, has become like the garden of Eden; and the cities that
            were ruined and waste and destroyed are fenced and
            inhabited”</span> (ver. 35). They will know that it is Jehovah's
            doing, and it will be marvellous in their eyes.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The last two
            verses seem to be an appendix. They deal with a special feature
            of the restoration, about which the minds of the exiles may have
            been exercised in thinking of the possibility of their
            deliverance. Where was the population of the new Israel to come
            from? The population of Judah must have been terribly reduced by
            the disastrous wars that had desolated the country since the time
            of Hezekiah. How was it possible, with a few thousands in exile,
            and a miserable remnant left in the land, to build up a strong
            and prosperous nation? This thought of theirs is met by the
            announcement of a great increase of the inhabitants of the land.
            Jehovah is ready to meet the questionings of human anxiety on
            this point: <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page339">[pg
            339]</span><a name="Pg339" id="Pg339" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            He will <span class="tei tei-q">“let Himself be inquired
            of”</span> for this.<a id="noteref_159" name="noteref_159" href=
            "#note_159"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">159</span></span></a> The
            remembrance of the sacrificial flocks that used to throng the
            streets leading to the Temple at the time of the great festivals
            supplies Ezekiel with an image of the teeming population that
            shall be in all the cities of Canaan when this prophecy is
            fulfilled.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such is in
            outline the scheme of redemption which Ezekiel presents to the
            minds of his readers. We shall reserve a fuller consideration of
            its more important doctrines for a separate chapter.<a id=
            "noteref_160" name="noteref_160" href="#note_160"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">160</span></span></a> One
            general application of its teaching, however, may be pointed out
            before leaving the subject. We see that for Ezekiel the mysteries
            and perplexities of the divine government find their solution in
            the idea of redemption. He is aware of the false impression
            necessarily produced on the heathen mind by God's dealings with
            His people, as long as the process is incomplete. On account of
            Israel's sin the revelation of God in providence is gradual and
            fragmentary, and seems even for a time to defeat its own end. The
            omnipotence of God was obscured by the very act of vindicating
            His holiness; and what was in itself a great step towards the
            complete revelation of His character came on the world in the
            first instance as an evidence of His impotence. But the prophet,
            looking beyond this to the final effect of God's work upon the
            world, sees that Jehovah can be truly known only in the
            manifestation of His redeeming grace. All the enigmas and
            contradictions that arise from imperfect comprehension of His
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page340">[pg 340]</span><a name=
            "Pg340" id="Pg340" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> purpose find their
            answer in this truth, that God will yet redeem Israel from its
            iniquities. God is His own interpreter, and when His work of
            salvation is finished the result will be a conclusive
            demonstration of that lofty conception of God to which the
            prophet had attained.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now this
            argument of Ezekiel's illustrates a principle of wide
            application. Many objections that are advanced against the
            theistic view of the universe seem to proceed on the assumption
            that the actual state of the world adequately represents the mind
            of its Creator. The heathen of Ezekiel's day have their modern
            representatives amongst dispassionate critics of Providence like
            J. S. Mill, who prove to their own satisfaction that the world
            cannot be the work of a being answering to the Christian idea of
            God. Do what you will, they say, to minimise the evils of
            existence, there is still an amount of undeniable pain and misery
            in the world which is fatal to your doctrine of an all-powerful
            and perfectly good Creator. Omnipotence could, and benevolence
            would, find a remedy; the Author of the universe, therefore,
            cannot possess both. God, in short, if there be a God, may be
            benevolent, or He may be omnipotent; but if benevolent He is not
            omnipotent, and if omnipotent He cannot be benevolent. How very
            convincing this is—from the standpoint of the neutral,
            non-Christian observer! And how poor a defence is sometimes made
            by the optimism which tries to make out that most evils are
            blessings in disguise, and the rest not worth minding! The
            Christian religion rises superior to such criticism, mainly in
            virtue of its living faith in redemption. It does not explain
            away evil, nor does it profess to account for its origin. It
            speaks of the whole creation groaning and travailing in pain
            together even until now. But it also describes the creation as
            waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God. It teaches us
            to discover in history the unfolding of a purpose of redemption,
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page341">[pg 341]</span><a name=
            "Pg341" id="Pg341" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the end of which
            will be the deliverance of mankind from the dominion of sin and
            their eternal blessedness in the kingdom of our God and His
            Christ. What Ezekiel foresaw in the form of a national
            restoration will be accomplished in a world-wide salvation, in a
            new heavens and a new earth, where there shall be no more curse.
            But meanwhile to judge of God from what is, apart from what is
            yet to be revealed, is to repeat the mistake of those who judged
            Jehovah to be an effete tribal deity because He had suffered His
            people to go forth out of their land. Those who have been brought
            into sympathy with the divine purpose, and have experienced the
            power of the Spirit of God in subduing the evil of their own
            hearts, can hold with unwavering confidence the hope of a
            universal victory of good over evil; and in the light of that
            hope the mysteries that surround the moral government of God
            cease to disturb their faith in the eternal Love which labours
            patiently and unceasingly for the redemption of man.</p>

          Chapter xxxvii.</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The most
          formidable obstacle to faith on the part of the exiles in the
          possibility of a national redemption was the complete
          disintegration of the ancient people of Israel. Hard as it was to
          realise that Jehovah still lived and reigned in spite of the
          cessation of His worship, and hard to hope for a recovery of the
          land of Canaan from the dominion of the heathen, these things were
          still conceivable. What almost surpassed conception was the
          restoration of national life to the feeble and demoralised remnant
          who had survived the fall of the state. It was no mere figure of
          speech that these exiles employed when they thought of their nation
          as dead. Cast off by its God, driven from its land, dismembered and
          deprived of its political organisation, Israel as a people had
          ceased to exist. Not only were the outward symbols of national
          unity destroyed, but the national spirit was extinct. Just as the
          destruction of the bodily organism implies the death of each
          separate member and organ and cell, so the individual Israelites
          felt themselves to be as dead men, dragging out an aimless
          existence without hope in the world. While Israel was alive they
          had lived in her and for her; all the best part of their life,
          religion, duty, liberty, and loyalty had been bound up with the
          consciousness of belonging to a nation with a proud history behind
          them and a brilliant future for their <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page343">[pg 343]</span><a name="Pg343" id="Pg343" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> posterity. Now that Israel had perished all
          spiritual and ideal significance had gone out of their lives; there
          remained but a selfish and sordid struggle for existence, and this
          they felt was not life, but death in life. And thus a promise of
          deliverance which appealed to them as members of a nation seemed to
          them a mockery, because they felt in themselves that the bond of
          national life was irrevocably broken.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The hardest part
          of Ezekiel's task at this time was therefore to revive the national
          sentiment, so as to meet the obvious objection that even if Jehovah
          were able to drive the heathen from His land there was still no
          people of Israel to whom He could give it. If only the exiles could
          be brought to believe that Israel had a future, that although now
          dead it could be raised from the dead, the spiritual meaning of
          their life would be given back to them in the form of hope, and
          faith in God would be possible. Accordingly the prophet's thoughts
          are now directed to the idea of the nation as the third factor of
          the Messianic hope. He has spoken of the kingdom and the land, and
          each of these ideals has led him on to the contemplation of the
          final condition of the world, in which Jehovah's purpose is fully
          manifested. So in this chapter he finds in the idea of the nation a
          new point of departure, from which he proceeds to delineate once
          more the Messianic salvation in its completeness.</p>

          <div class="tei tei-div" style=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The vision of
            the valley of dry bones described in the first part of the
            chapter contains the answer to the desponding thoughts of the
            exiles, and seems indeed to be directly suggested by the figure
            in which the popular feeling was currently expressed:
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Our bones are dried; our hope is lost:
            we feel ourselves cut off”</span> (ver. 11). <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page344">[pg 344]</span><a name="Pg344" id=
            "Pg344" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> The fact that the answer came
            to the prophet in a state of trance may perhaps indicate that his
            mind had brooded over these words of the people for some time
            before the moment of inspiration. Recognising how faithfully they
            represented the actual situation, he was yet unable to suggest an
            adequate solution of the difficulty by means of the prophetic
            conceptions hitherto revealed to him. Such a vision as this seems
            to presuppose a period of intense mental activity on the part of
            Ezekiel, during which the despairing utterance of his compatriots
            sounded in his ears; and the image of the dried bones of the
            house of Israel so fixed itself in his mind that he could not
            escape its gloomy associations except by a direct communication
            from above. When at last the hand of the Lord came upon him, the
            revelation clothed itself in a form corresponding to his previous
            meditations; the emblem of death and despair is transformed into
            a symbol of assured hope through the astounding vision which
            unfolds itself before his inner eye.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the ecstasy
            he feels himself led out in spirit to the plain which had been
            the scene of former appearances of God to His prophet. But on
            this occasion he sees it covered with bones—<span class=
            "tei tei-q">“very many on the surface of the valley, and very
            dry.”</span> He is made to pass round about them, in order that
            the full impression of this spectacle of desolation might sink
            into his mind. His attention is engrossed by two facts—their
            exceeding great number, and their parched appearance, as if they
            had lain there long. In other circumstances the question might
            have suggested itself, How came these bones there? What countless
            host has perished here, leaving its unburied bones to bleach and
            wither on the open plain? But the prophet has no need to think of
            this. They are the bones which had been familiar to his waking
            thoughts, the dry bones of the house of Israel. The question he
            hears addressed <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page345">[pg
            345]</span><a name="Pg345" id="Pg345" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            to him is not, Whence are these bones? but, Can these bones live?
            It is the problem which had exercised his faith in thinking of a
            national restoration which thus comes back to him in vision, to
            receive its final solution from Him who alone can give it.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The prophet's
            hesitating answer probably reveals the struggle between faith and
            sight, between hope and fear, which was latent in his mind. He
            dare not say No, for that would be to limit the power of Him whom
            he knows to be omnipotent, and also to shut out the last gleam of
            hope from his own mind. Yet in presence of that appalling scene
            of hopeless decay and death he cannot of his own initiative
            assert the possibility of resurrection. In the abstract all
            things are possible with God; but whether this particular thing,
            so inconceivable to men, is within the active purpose of God, is
            a question which none can answer save God Himself. Ezekiel does
            what man must always do in such a case—he throws himself back on
            God, and reverently awaits the disclosure of His will, saying,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“O Jehovah God, Thou knowest.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is
            instructive to notice that the divine answer comes through the
            consciousness of a duty. Ezekiel is commanded first of all to
            prophesy over these dry bones; and in the words given him to
            utter the solution of his own inward perplexity is wrapped up.
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Say unto them, O ye dry bones, hear the
            word of Jehovah.... Behold, I will cause breath to enter into
            you, and ye shall live”</span> (vv. 4, 5). In this way he is not
            only taught that the agency by which Jehovah will effect His
            purpose is the prophetic word, but he is also reminded that the
            truth now revealed to him is to be the guide of his practical
            ministry, and that only in the steadfast discharge of his
            prophetic duty can he hold fast the hope of Israel's
            resurrection. The problem that has exercised him is not one that
            can be settled in retirement and inaction. What <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page346">[pg 346]</span><a name="Pg346" id=
            "Pg346" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> he receives is not a mere
            answer, but a message, and the delivery of the message is the
            only way in which he can realise the truth of it, his activity as
            a prophet being indeed a necessary element in the fulfilment of
            his words. Let him preach the word of God to these dry bones, and
            he will know that they can live; but if he fails to do this, he
            will sink back into the unbelief to which all things are
            impossible. Faith comes in the act of prophesying.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Ezekiel did as
            he was commanded; he prophesied over the dry bones, and
            immediately he was sensible of the effect of his words. He heard
            a rustling, and looking he saw that the bones were coming
            together, bone to his bone. He does not need to tell us how his
            heart rejoiced at this first sign of life returning to these dead
            bones, and as he watched the whole process by which they were
            built up into the semblance of men. It is described in minute
            detail, so that no feature of the impression produced by the
            stupendous miracle may be lost. It is divided into two stages,
            the restoration of the bodily frame and the imparting of the
            principle of life.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This division
            cannot have any special significance when applied to the actual
            nation, such as that the outward order of the state must be first
            established, and then the national consciousness renewed. It
            belongs to the imagery of the vision, and follows the order
            observed in the original creation of man as described in the
            second chapter of Genesis. God first formed man of the dust of
            the ground, and afterwards breathed into his nostrils the breath
            of life, so that he became a living soul. So here we have first a
            description of the process by which the bodies were built up, the
            skeletons being formed from the scattered bones, and then clothed
            successively with sinews and flesh and skin. The reanimation of
            these still lifeless bodies is a separate act of creative energy,
            in which, however, the agency is still the word of God in the
            mouth of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page347">[pg
            347]</span><a name="Pg347" id="Pg347" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            prophet. He is bidden call for the breath to <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“come from the four winds of heaven, and breathe upon
            these slain that they may live.”</span> In Hebrew the words for
            wind, breath, and spirit are identical; and thus the wind becomes
            a symbol of the universal divine Spirit which is the source of
            all life, while the breath is a symbol of that Spirit as so to
            speak specialised in the individual man, or in other words of his
            personal life. In the case of the first man Jehovah breathed into
            his nostrils the breath of life, and the idea here is precisely
            the same. The wind from the four quarters of heaven which becomes
            the breath of this vast assemblage of men is conceived as the
            breath of God, and symbolises the life-giving Spirit which makes
            each of them a living person. The resurrection is complete. The
            men live, and stand up upon their feet an exceeding great
            army.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is the
            simplest, as well as the most suggestive, of Ezekiel's visions,
            and carries its interpretation on the face of it. The single idea
            which it expresses is the restoration of the Hebrew nationality
            through the quickening influence of the Spirit of Jehovah on the
            surviving members of the old house of Israel. It is not a
            prophecy of the resurrection of individual Israelites who have
            perished. The bones are <span class="tei tei-q">“the whole house
            of Israel”</span> now in exile; they are alive as individuals,
            but as members of a nation they are dead and hopeless of revival.
            This is made clear by the explanation of the vision given in vv.
            11-14. It is addressed to those who think of themselves as cut
            off from the higher interests and activities of the national
            life. By a slight change of figure they are conceived as dead and
            buried; and the resurrection is represented as an opening of
            their graves. But the grave is no more to be understood literally
            than the dry bones of the vision itself; both are symbols of the
            gloomy and despairing view which the exiles take of their own
            condition. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page348">[pg
            348]</span><a name="Pg348" id="Pg348" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            The substance of the prophet's message is that the God who raises
            the dead and calls the things that are not as though they were is
            able to bring together the scattered members of the house of
            Israel and form them into a new people through the operation of
            His life-giving Spirit.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It has often
            been supposed that, although the passage may not directly teach
            the resurrection of the body, it nevertheless implies a certain
            familiarity with that doctrine on the part of Ezekiel, if not of
            his hearers likewise. If the raising of dead men to life could be
            used as an analogy of a national restoration, the former
            conception must have been at least more obvious than the latter,
            otherwise the prophet would be explaining <span class=
            "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">obscurum per
            obscurius</span></span>. This argument, however, has only a
            superficial plausibility. It confounds two things which are
            distinct—the mere conception of resurrection, which is all that
            was necessary to make the vision intelligible, and settled faith
            in it as an element of the Messianic expectation. That God by a
            miracle could restore the dead to life no devout Israelite ever
            doubted.<a id="noteref_161" name="noteref_161" href=
            "#note_161"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">161</span></span></a> But
            it is to be noted that the recorded instances of such miracles
            are all of those recently dead; and there is no evidence of a
            general belief in the possibility of resurrection for those whose
            bones were scattered and dry. It is this very impossibility,
            indeed, that gives point to the metaphor under which the people
            here express their sense of hopelessness. Moreover, if the
            prophet had presupposed the doctrine of individual resurrection,
            he could hardly have used it as an illustration in the way he
            does. The mere prospect of a resuscitation of the multitudes of
            Israelites who had perished would of itself have been a
            sufficient answer to the despondency of the exiles; and it would
            have <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page349">[pg
            349]</span><a name="Pg349" id="Pg349" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            been an anti-climax to use it as an argument for something much
            less wonderful. We must also bear in mind that while the
            resurrection of a nation may be to us little more than a figure
            of speech, to the Hebrew mind it was an object of thought more
            real and tangible than the idea of personal immortality.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It would
            appear therefore that in the order of revelation the hope of the
            resurrection is first presented in the promise of a resurrection
            of the dead nation of Israel, and only in the second instance as
            the resurrection of individual Israelites who should have passed
            away without sharing in the glory of the latter days. Like the
            early converts to Christianity, the Old Testament believers
            sorrowed for those who fell asleep when the Messiah's kingdom was
            supposed to be just at hand, until they found consolation in the
            blessed hope of a resurrection with which Paul comforted the
            Church at Thessalonica.<a id="noteref_162" name="noteref_162"
            href="#note_162"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">162</span></span></a> In
            Ezekiel we find that doctrine as yet only in its more general
            form of a national resurrection; but it can hardly be doubted
            that the form in which he expressed it prepared the way for the
            fuller revelation of a resurrection of the individual. In two
            later passages of the prophetic Scriptures we seem to find clear
            indications of progress in this direction. One is a difficult
            verse in the twenty-sixth chapter of Isaiah—part of a prophecy
            usually assigned to a period later than Ezekiel—where the writer,
            after a lamentation over the disappointments and wasted efforts
            of the present, suddenly breaks into a rapture of hope as he
            thinks of a time when departed Israelites shall be restored to
            life to join the ranks of the ransomed people of God:
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Let thy dead live again! Let my dead
            bodies arise! Awake and rejoice, ye that dwell in the dust, for
            thy dew is a dew of light, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page350">[pg 350]</span><a name="Pg350" id="Pg350" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> and the earth shall yield up [her]
            shades.”</span><a id="noteref_163" name="noteref_163" href=
            "#note_163"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">163</span></span></a>
            There does not seem to be any doubt that what is here predicted
            is the actual resurrection of individual members of the people of
            Israel to share in the blessings of the kingdom of God. The other
            passage referred to is in the book of Daniel, where we have the
            first explicit prediction of a resurrection both of the just and
            the unjust. In the time of trouble when the people is delivered
            <span class="tei tei-q">“many of them that sleep in the dust of
            the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to
            shame and everlasting contempt.”</span><a id="noteref_164" name=
            "noteref_164" href="#note_164"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These remarks
            are made merely to show in what sense Ezekiel's vision may be
            regarded as a contribution to the Old Testament doctrine of
            personal immortality. It is so not by its direct teaching, nor
            yet by its presuppositions, but by the suggestiveness of its
            imagery, opening out a line of thought which under the guidance
            of the Spirit of truth led to a fuller disclosure of the care of
            God for the individual life, and His purpose to redeem from the
            power of the grave those who had departed this life in His faith
            and fear.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But this line
            of inquiry lies somewhat apart from the main teaching of the
            passage before us as a message for the Church in all ages. The
            passage teaches with striking clearness the continuity of God's
            redeeming work in the world, in spite of hindrances which to
            human eyes seem insurmountable. The gravest hindrance, both in
            appearance and in reality, is the decay of faith and vital
            religion in the Church itself. There are times when earnest men
            are tempted to say that the Church's hope is lost and her bones
            are dried—when laxity of life and lukewarmness in devotion
            pervade all her members, and she ceases to influence the world
            for good. And yet when we consider <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page351">[pg 351]</span><a name="Pg351" id="Pg351" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> that the whole history of God's cause is
            one long process of raising dead souls to spiritual life and
            building up a kingdom of God out of fallen humanity, we see that
            the true hope of the Church can never be lost. It lies in the
            life-giving, regenerating power of the divine Spirit, and the
            promise that the word of God does not return to Him void but
            prospers in the thing whereto He sends it. That is the great
            lesson of Ezekiel's vision, and although its immediate
            application may be limited to the occasion that called it forth,
            yet the analogy on which it is founded is taken up by our Lord
            Himself and extended to the proclamation of His truth to the
            world at large: <span class="tei tei-q">“The hour is coming, and
            now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God; and
            they that hear shall live.”</span><a id="noteref_165" name=
            "noteref_165" href="#note_165"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">165</span></span></a> We
            perhaps too readily empty these strong terms of their meaning.
            The Spirit of God is apt to become a mere expression for the
            religious and moral influences lodged in a Christian society, and
            we come to rely on these agencies for the dissemination of
            Christian principles and the formation of Christian character. We
            forget that behind all this there is something which is compared
            to the imparting of life where there was none, something which is
            the work of the Spirit of which we cannot tell whence it cometh
            and whither it goeth. But in times of low spirituality, when the
            love of many waxes cold, and there are few signs of zeal and
            activity in the service of Christ, men learn to fall back in
            faith on the invisible power of God to make His word effectual
            for the revival of His cause among men. And this happens
            constantly in narrow spheres which may never attract the notice
            of the world. There are positions in the Church still where
            Christ's servants are called to labour in the faith of Ezekiel,
            with appearances all against them, and nothing <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page352">[pg 352]</span><a name="Pg352" id=
            "Pg352" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> to inspire them but the
            conviction that the word they preach is the power of God and able
            even to bring life to the dead.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The second
            half of the chapter speaks of a special feature of the national
            restoration, the reunion of the kingdoms of Judah and Israel
            under one sceptre. This is represented first of all by a symbolic
            action. The prophet is directed to take two pieces of wood,
            apparently in the form of sceptres, and to write upon them
            inscriptions dedicating them respectively to Judah and Joseph,
            the heads of the two confederacies out of which the rival
            monarchies were formed. The <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“companions”</span> (ver. 16)—<span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
            allies—of Judah are the two tribes of Benjamin and Simeon; those
            of Joseph are all the other tribes, who stood under the hegemony
            of Ephraim. If the second inscription is rather more complicated
            than the first, it is because of the fact that there was no
            actual tribe of Joseph. It therefore runs thus: <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“For Joseph, the staff of Ephraim, and all the house
            of Israel his confederates.”</span> These two staves then he is
            to put together so that they become one sceptre in his hand. It
            is a little difficult to decide whether this was a sign that was
            actually performed before the people, or one that is only
            imagined. It depends partly on what we take to be meant by the
            joining of the two pieces. If Ezekiel merely took two sticks, put
            them end to end, and made them look like one, then no doubt he
            did this in public, for otherwise there would be no use in
            mentioning the circumstance at all. But if the meaning is, as
            seems more probable, that when the rods are put together they
            miraculously grow into one, then we see that such a sign has a
            value for the prophet's own mind as a symbol of the truth
            revealed to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page353">[pg
            353]</span><a name="Pg353" id="Pg353" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            him, and it is no longer necessary to assume that the action was
            really performed. The purpose of the sign is not merely to
            suggest the idea of political unity, which is too simple to
            require any such illustration, but rather to indicate the
            completeness of the union and the divine force needed to bring it
            about. The difficulty of conceiving a perfect fusion of the two
            parts of the nation was really very great, the cleavage between
            Judah and the North being much older than the monarchy, and
            having been accentuated by centuries of political separation and
            rivalry.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To us the most
            noteworthy fact is the steadfastness with which the prophets of
            this period cling to the hope of a restoration of the northern
            tribes, although nearly a century and a half had now elapsed
            since <span class="tei tei-q">“Ephraim was broken from being a
            people.”</span><a id="noteref_166" name="noteref_166" href=
            "#note_166"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">166</span></span></a>
            Ezekiel, like Jeremiah, is unable to think of an Israel which
            does not include the representatives of the ten northern tribes.
            Whether any communication was kept up with the colonies of
            Israelites that had been transported from Samaria to Assyria we
            do not know, but they are regarded as still existing, and still
            remembered by Jehovah. The resurrection of the nation which
            Ezekiel has just predicted is expressly said to apply to the
            whole house of Israel, and now he goes on to announce that this
            <span class="tei tei-q">“exceeding great army”</span> shall march
            to its land not under two banners, but under one.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have
            touched already, in speaking of the Messianic idea, on the
            reasons which lead the prophets to put so much emphasis on this
            union. They felt as strongly on the point as a High Churchman
            does about the sin of schism, and it would not be difficult for
            the latter to show that his point of view and his ideals closely
            resemble those <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page354">[pg
            354]</span><a name="Pg354" id="Pg354" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            of the prophets. The rending of the body of Christ which is
            supposed to be involved in a breach of external unity is
            paralleled by the disruption of the Hebrew state, which violates
            the unity of the one people of Jehovah. The idea of the Church as
            the bride of Christ, is the same idea under which Hosea expresses
            the relations between Jehovah and Israel, and it necessarily
            carries with it the unity of the people of Israel in the one case
            and of the Church in the other. It must be admitted also that the
            evils resulting from the division between Judah and Israel have
            been reproduced, with consequences a thousand times more
            disastrous to religion, in the strife and uncharitableness, the
            party spirit and jealousies and animosities, which different
            denominations of Christians have invariably exhibited towards
            each other when they were close enough for mutual interest. But
            granting all this, and granting that what is called schism is
            essentially the same thing that the prophets desired to see
            removed, it does not at once follow that dissent is in itself
            sinful, and still less that the sin is necessarily on the side of
            the Dissenter. The question is whether the national standpoint of
            the prophets is altogether applicable to the communion of saints
            in Christ, whether the body of Christ is really torn asunder by
            differences in organisation and opinion, whether, in short,
            anything is necessary to avoid the guilt of schism beyond keeping
            the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. The Old Testament
            dealt with men in the mass, as members of a nation, and its
            standards can hardly be adequate to the polity of a religion
            which has to provide for the freedom of the individual conscience
            before God. At the worst the Dissenter may point out that the Old
            Testament schism was necessary as a protest against tyranny and
            despotism, that in this aspect it was sanctioned by the inspired
            prophets of the age, that its undoubted evils were partly
            compensated by a freer <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page355">[pg
            355]</span><a name="Pg355" id="Pg355" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            expansion of religious life, and finally that even the prophets
            did not expect it to be healed before the millennium.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From the idea
            of the reunited nation Ezekiel returns easily to the promise of
            the Davidic king and the blessings of the Messianic dispensation.
            The one people implies one shepherd, and also one land, and one
            spirit to walk in Jehovah's judgments and to observe His statutes
            to do them. The various elements which enter into the conception
            of national salvation are thus gathered up and combined in one
            picture of the people's everlasting felicity. And the whole is
            crowned by the promise of Jehovah's presence with the people,
            sanctifying and protecting them from His sanctuary. This final
            condition of things is permanent and eternal. The sources of
            internal dispeace are removed by the washing away of Israel's
            iniquities, and the impossibility of any disturbance from without
            is illustrated by the onslaught of the heathen nations described
            in the following chapters.</p>

          Israel.</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In an early
          chapter of this volume<a id="noteref_167" name="noteref_167" href=
          "#note_167"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">167</span></span></a> we
          had occasion to notice some theological principles which appear to
          have guided the prophet's thinking from the first. It was evident
          even then that these principles pointed towards a definite theory
          of the conversion of Israel and the process by which it was to be
          effected. In subsequent prophecies we have seen how constantly
          Ezekiel's thoughts revert to this theme, as now one aspect of it
          and then another is disclosed to him. We have also glanced at one
          passage<a id="noteref_168" name="noteref_168" href=
          "#note_168"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">168</span></span></a> which
          seemed to be a connected statement of the divine procedure as
          bearing on the restoration of Israel. But we have now reached a
          stage in the exposition where all this lies behind us. In the
          chapters that remain to be considered the regeneration of the
          people is assumed to have taken place; their religion and their
          morality are regarded as established on a stable and permanent
          basis, and all that has to be done is to describe the institutions
          by which the benefits of salvation may be conserved and handed down
          from age to age of the Messianic dispensation. The present is
          therefore a fitting opportunity for an attempt to describe
          Ezekiel's doctrine of conversion as a whole. It is all the more
          desirable that the attempt should be made because the national
          salvation is the central interest of the whole <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page357">[pg 357]</span><a name="Pg357" id="Pg357"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> book; and if we can understand the
          prophet's teaching on this subject, we shall have the key to his
          whole system of theology.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">1. The first
          point to be noticed, and the one most characteristic of Ezekiel, is
          the divine motive for the redemption of Israel—Jehovah's regard for
          His own name. This thought finds expression in many parts of the
          book, but nowhere more clearly than in the twenty-second verse of
          the thirty-sixth chapter: <span class="tei tei-q">“Not for your
          sakes do I act, O house of Israel, but for My holy name, which ye
          have profaned among the heathen, whither ye went.”</span> Similarly
          in the thirty-second verse: <span class="tei tei-q">“Not for your
          sakes do I act, saith the Lord Jehovah, be it known unto you: be
          ashamed and confounded for your own ways, O house of
          Israel.”</span> There is an apparent harshness in these
          declarations which makes it easy to present them in a repellent
          light. They have been taken to mean that Jehovah is absolutely
          indifferent to the weal or woe of the people except in so far as it
          reflects on His own credit with the world; that He accepts the
          relationship between Him and Israel, but does so in the spirit of a
          selfish parent who exerts himself to save his child from disgrace
          merely in order to prevent his own name from being dragged in the
          mire. It would be difficult to explain how such a Being should be
          at all concerned about what men think of Him. If Jehovah has no
          interest in Israel, it is hard to see why He should be sensitive to
          the opinion of the rest of mankind. That is an idea of God which no
          man can seriously hold, and we may be certain that it is a
          perversion of Ezekiel's meaning. Everything depends on how much is
          included in the <span class="tei tei-q">“name”</span> of Jehovah.
          If it denotes mere arbitrary power, delighting in its own exercise
          and the awe which it excites, then we might conceive of the divine
          action as ruled by a boundless egoism, to which all human interests
          are alike <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page358">[pg
          358]</span><a name="Pg358" id="Pg358" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          indifferent. But that is not the conception of God which Ezekiel
          has. He is a moral Being, one who has compassion on other things
          besides His own name,<a id="noteref_169" name="noteref_169" href=
          "#note_169"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">169</span></span></a> one
          who has no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that he should
          turn from his way and live.<a id="noteref_170" name="noteref_170"
          href="#note_170"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">170</span></span></a> But
          when this aspect of His character is included in the name of God,
          we see that regard for His name cannot mean mere regard for His own
          interests, as if these were opposed to the interests of His
          creatures; but means the desire to be known as He is, as a God of
          mercy and righteousness as well as of infinite power.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The name of God
          is that by which He is known amongst men. It is more than His
          honour or reputation, although that is included in it according to
          Hebrew idiom; it is the expression of His character or His
          personality. To act for His name's sake, therefore, is to act so
          that His true character may be more fully revealed, and so that
          men's thoughts of Him may more truly correspond to that which in
          Himself He is. There is plainly nothing in this inconsistent with
          the deepest interest in men's spiritual well-being. Jehovah is the
          God of salvation, and desires to reveal Himself as such; and
          whether we say that He saves men in order that He may be known as a
          Saviour, or that He makes Himself known in order to save them, does
          not make any real difference. Revelation and redemption are one
          thing. And when Ezekiel says that regard for His own name is the
          supreme motive of Jehovah's action, he does not teach that Jehovah
          is uninfluenced by care for man; if the question had been put to
          him, he would have said that care for man is one of the attributes
          included in the Name which Jehovah is concerned to reveal.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The real meaning
          of Ezekiel's doctrine will perhaps be best understood from its
          negative statement. What is <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page359">[pg 359]</span><a name="Pg359" id="Pg359" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> meant to be excluded by the expression
          <span class="tei tei-q">“not for your sakes”</span>? It <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">might</span></em>
          no doubt mean, <span class="tei tei-q">“not because I care at all
          for you”</span>; but that we have seen to be inconsistent with
          other aspects of Ezekiel's teaching about the divine character. All
          that it necessarily implies is <span class="tei tei-q">“not for any
          good that I find in you.”</span> It is a protest against the idea
          of Pharisaic self-righteousness that a man may have a legal claim
          upon God through his own merits. It is true that that was not a
          prevalent notion amongst the people in the time of Ezekiel. But
          their state of mind was one in which such a thought might easily
          arise. They were convinced of having been entirely in the wrong in
          their conceptions of the relation between them and Jehovah. The
          pagan notion that the people is indispensable to the god on account
          of a physical bond between them had broken down in the recent
          experience of Israel, and with it had vanished every natural ground
          for the hope of salvation. In such circumstances the promise of
          deliverance would naturally raise the thought that there must after
          all be something in Israel that was pleasing to Jehovah, and that
          the prophet's denunciations of their past sins were overdone. In
          order to guard against that error Ezekiel explicitly asserts, what
          was involved in the whole of his teaching, that the mercy of God
          was not called forth by any good in Israel, but that nevertheless
          there are immutable reasons in the divine nature on which the
          certainty of Israel's redemption may be built.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The truth here
          taught is therefore, in theological language, the sovereignty of
          the divine grace. Ezekiel's statement of it is liable to all the
          distortions and misrepresentations to which that doctrine has been
          subjected at the hands both of its friends and its enemies; but
          when fairly treated it is no more objectionable than any other
          expression of the same truth to be found in Scripture. In Ezekiel's
          case it was the result of a penetrating analysis <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page360">[pg 360]</span><a name="Pg360" id="Pg360"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of the moral condition of his people
          which led him to see that there was nothing in them to suggest the
          possibility of their being restored. It is only when he falls back
          on the thought of what God is, on the divine necessity of
          vindicating His holiness in the salvation of His people, that his
          faith in Israel's future finds a sure point of support. And so in
          general a profound sense of human sinfulness will always throw the
          mind back on the idea of God as the one immovable ground of
          confidence in the ultimate redemption of the individual and the
          world. When the doctrine is pressed to the conclusion that God
          saves men in spite of themselves, and merely to display His power
          over them, it becomes false and pernicious, and indeed
          self-contradictory. But so long as we hold fast to the truth that
          God is love, and that the glory of God is the manifestation of His
          love, the doctrine of the divine sovereignty only expresses the
          unchangeableness of that love and its final victory over the sin of
          the world.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">2. The
          intellectual side of the conversion of Israel is the acceptance of
          that idea of God which to the prophet is summed up in the name of
          Jehovah. This is expressed in the standing formula which denotes
          the effect of all God's dealings with men, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“They shall know that I am Jehovah.”</span> We need
          not, however, repeat what has been already said as to the meaning
          of these words.<a id="noteref_171" name="noteref_171" href=
          "#note_171"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">171</span></span></a> Nor
          shall we dwell on the effect of the national judgment as a means
          towards producing a right impression of Jehovah's nature. It is
          possible that as time went on Ezekiel came to see that chastisement
          alone would not effect the moral change in the exiles which was
          necessary to bring them into sympathy with the divine purposes. In
          the early prophecy of ch. vi. the knowledge of Jehovah and the
          self-condemnation which accompanies it are spoken of as the direct
          result of His judgment on sin,<a id="noteref_172" name=
          "noteref_172" href="#note_172"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">172</span></span></a> and
          this <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page361">[pg 361]</span><a name=
          "Pg361" id="Pg361" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> undoubtedly was one
          element in the conversion of the people to right thoughts about
          God. But in all other passages this feeling of self-loathing is not
          the beginning but the end of conversion; it is caused by the
          experience of pardon and redemption following upon
          punishment.<a id="noteref_173" name="noteref_173" href=
          "#note_173"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">173</span></span></a> There
          is also another aspect of judgment which may be mentioned in
          passing for the sake of completeness. It is that which is expounded
          in the end of the twentieth chapter. There the judgment which still
          stands between the exiles and the return to their own land is
          represented as a sifting process, in which those who have undergone
          a spiritual change are finally separated from those who perish in
          their impenitence. This idea does not occur in the prophecies
          subsequent to the fall of Jerusalem, and it may be doubtful how it
          fits into the scheme of redemption there unfolded. The prophet here
          regards conversion as a process wholly carried through by the
          operation of Jehovah on the mind of the people; and what we have
          next to consider is the steps by which this great end is
          accomplished. They are these two—forgiveness and regeneration.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">3. The
          forgiveness of sins is denoted in the thirty-sixth chapter, as we
          have already seen, by the symbol of sprinkling with clean water.
          But it must not be supposed that this isolated figure is the only
          form in which the doctrine appears in Ezekiel's exposition of the
          process of salvation. On the contrary forgiveness is the
          fundamental assumption of the whole argument, and is present in
          every promise of future blessedness to the people. For the Old
          Testament idea of forgiveness is extremely simple, resting as it
          does on the analogy of forgiveness in human life. The spiritual
          fact which constitutes the essence of forgiveness is the change in
          Jehovah's disposition towards <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page362">[pg 362]</span><a name="Pg362" id="Pg362" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> His people which is manifested by the renewal
          of those indispensable conditions of national well-being which in
          His anger He had taken away. The restoration of Israel to its own
          land is thus not simply a token of forgiveness, but the act of
          forgiveness itself, and the only form in which the fact could be
          realised in the experience of the nation. In this sense the whole
          of Ezekiel's predictions of the Messianic deliverance and the
          glories that follow it are one continuous promise of forgiveness,
          setting forth the truth that Jehovah's love to His people persists
          in spite of their sin, and works victoriously for their redemption
          and restoration to the full enjoyment of His favour. There is
          perhaps one point in which we discover a difference between
          Ezekiel's conception and that of his predecessors. According to the
          common prophetic doctrine penitence, including amendment, is the
          moral effect of Jehovah's chastisement, and is the necessary
          condition of pardon. We have seen that there is some doubt whether
          Ezekiel regarded repentance as the result of judgment, and the same
          doubt exists as to whether in the order of salvation repentance is
          a preliminary or a consequence of forgiveness. The truth is that
          the prophet appears to combine both conceptions. In urging
          individuals to prepare for the coming of the kingdom of God he
          makes repentance a necessary condition of entering it; but in
          describing the whole process of salvation as the work of God he
          makes contrition for sin the result of reflection on the goodness
          of Jehovah already experienced in the peaceful occupation of the
          land of Canaan.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">4. The idea of
          regeneration is very prominent in Ezekiel's teaching. The need for
          a radical change in the national character was impressed on him by
          the spectacle which he witnessed daily of evil tendencies and
          practices persisted in, in spite of the clearest demonstration that
          they were hateful to Jehovah and had been <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page363">[pg 363]</span><a name="Pg363" id="Pg363" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> the cause of the nation's calamities. And he
          does not ascribe this state of things merely to the influence of
          tradition and public opinion and evil example, but traces it to its
          source in the hardness and corruption of the individual nature. It
          was evident that no mere change of intellectual conviction would
          avail to alter the currents of life among the exiles; the heart
          must be renewed, out of which are the issues both of personal and
          national life. Hence the promise of regeneration is expressed as a
          taking away of the stony, unimpressible heart that was in them, and
          putting within them a heart of flesh, a new heart and a new spirit.
          In exhorting individuals to repentance Ezekiel calls on them to
          make themselves a new heart and a new spirit,<a id="noteref_174"
          name="noteref_174" href="#note_174"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">174</span></span></a>
          meaning that their repentance must be genuine, extending to the
          inner motives and springs of action, and not be confined to outward
          signs of mourning.<a id="noteref_175" name="noteref_175" href=
          "#note_175"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">175</span></span></a> But
          in other connections the new heart and spirit is represented as a
          gift, the result of the operation of the divine grace.<a id=
          "noteref_176" name="noteref_176" href="#note_176"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">176</span></span></a></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Closely
          connected with this, perhaps only the same truth in another form,
          is the promise of the outpouring of the Spirit of God.<a id=
          "noteref_177" name="noteref_177" href="#note_177"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">177</span></span></a> The
          general expectation of a new supernatural power infused into the
          national life in the latter days is common in the prophets. It
          appears in Hosea under the beautiful image of the dew,<a id=
          "noteref_178" name="noteref_178" href="#note_178"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">178</span></span></a> and
          in Isaiah it is expressed in the consciousness that the desolation
          of the land must continue <span class="tei tei-q">“until spirit be
          poured upon us from on high.”</span><a id="noteref_179" name=

          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">179</span></span></a> But
          no earlier prophet presents the idea of the Spirit as a principle
          of regeneration with the precision and clearness which the doctrine
          assumes in the hands of Ezekiel. What in Hosea and <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page364">[pg 364]</span><a name="Pg364" id="Pg364"

          because the inward impulse of their own regenerate nature will lead
          them to fulfil it perfectly. The inefficiency of law as a mere
          external authority acting on men by hope of reward and fear of
          punishment was perceived both by Jeremiah and Ezekiel almost as
          clearly as by Paul, although this conviction on the part of the
          prophets was based on observation of national depravity rather than
          on their personal experience. It led Jeremiah to the conception of
          a new covenant under which Jehovah will write His law on men's
          hearts;<a id="noteref_183" name="noteref_183" href=

          Ezekiel expresses the same truth in the promise of a new Spirit
          inclining the people to walk in Jehovah's statutes and to keep His
          judgments.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The second
          inward result of salvation is shame and self-loathing on account of
          past transgressions.<a id="noteref_184" name="noteref_184" href=

          seems strange that the prophet should dwell so much on this as a
          mark of Israel's saved condition. His strong protest against the
          doctrine of inherited guilt in the eighteenth <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page365">[pg 365]</span><a name="Pg365" id="Pg365"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> chapter would have led us to expect
          that the members of the new Israel would not be conscious of any
          responsibility for the sins of the old. But here, as in other
          instances, the conception of the personified nation proves itself a
          better vehicle of religious truth from the Old Testament standpoint
          than the religious relations of the individual. The continuity of
          the national consciousness sustains that profound sense of
          unworthiness which is an essential element of true reconciliation
          to God, although each individual Israelite in the kingdom of God
          knows that he is not accountable for the iniquity of his
          fathers.</p>

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This outline of
          the prophet's conception of salvation illustrates the truth of the
          remark that Ezekiel is the first dogmatic theologian. In so far as
          it is the business of a theologian to exhibit the logical
          connection of the ideas which express man's relation to God,
          Ezekiel more than any other prophet may claim the title. Truths
          which are the presuppositions of all prophecy are to him objects of
          conscious reflection, and emerge from his hands in the shape of
          clearly formulated doctrines. There is probably no single element
          of his teaching which may not be traced in the writings of his
          predecessors, but there is none which has not gained from him a
          more distinct intellectual expression. And what is specially
          remarkable is the manner in which the doctrines are bound together
          in the unity of a system. In grounding the necessity of redemption
          in the divine nature, Ezekiel may be said to foreshadow the
          theology which is often called Calvinistic or Augustinian, but
          which might more truly be called Pauline. Although the final remedy
          for the sin of the world had not yet been revealed, the scheme of
          redemption disclosed to Ezekiel agrees with much of the teaching of
          the New Testament regarding the effects of the work of Christ on
          the individual. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page366">[pg
          366]</span><a name="Pg366" id="Pg366" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          Speaking of the passage ch. xxxvi. 16-38 Dr. Davidson writes as
          follows:—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Probably no passage in the Old Testament of the same
          extent offers so complete a parallel to New Testament doctrine,
          particularly to that of St. Paul. It is doubtful if the apostle
          quotes Ezekiel anywhere, but his line of thought entirely coincides
          with his. The same conceptions and in the same order belong to
          both,—forgiveness (ver. 25); regeneration, a new heart and spirit
          (ver. 26); the Spirit of God as the ruling power in the new life
          (ver. 27); the issue of this, the keeping of the requirements of
          God's law (ver. 27; Rom. viii. 4); the effect of being <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘under grace’</span> in softening the human heart and
          leading to obedience (ver. 31; Rom. vi., vii.); and the organic
          connection of Israel's history with Jehovah's revelation of Himself
          to the nations (vv. 33-36; Rom. xi.).”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These chapters
          give the impression of having been intended to stand at the close
          of the book of Ezekiel. Their present position is best explained on
          the supposition that the original collection of Ezekiel's
          prophecies actually ended here, and that the remaining chapters
          (xl.-xlviii.) form an appendix, added at a later period without
          disturbing the plan on which the book had been arranged. In
          chronological order, at all events, the oracle on Gog comes after
          the vision of the last nine chapters. It marks the utmost limit of
          Ezekiel's vision of the future of the kingdom of God. It represents
          the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">dénouement</span></span> of the great drama of
          Jehovah's self-manifestation to the nations of the world. It
          describes an event which is to take place in the far-distant
          future, long after the Messianic age has begun and after Israel has
          long been settled peacefully in its own land. Certain
          considerations, which we shall notice at the end of this lecture,
          brought home to the prophet's mind the conviction that the lessons
          of Israel's restoration did not afford a sufficient illustration of
          Jehovah's glory or of the meaning of His past dealings with His
          people. The conclusive demonstration of this is therefore to be
          furnished by the destruction of Gog and his myrmidons when in the
          latter days they make an onslaught on the Holy Land.</p>

          kingdom of God, is peculiar to Ezekiel amongst the prophets of the
          Old Testament. According to other prophets the judgment of the
          nations takes place in a <span class="tei tei-q">“day of
          Jehovah”</span> which is the crisis of history; and the Messianic
          era which follows is a period of undisturbed tranquillity in which
          the knowledge of the true God penetrates to the remotest regions of
          the earth. In Ezekiel, on the other hand, the judgment of the world
          is divided into two acts. The nearer nations which have played a
          part in the history of Israel in the past form a group by
          themselves; their punishment is a preliminary to the restoration of
          Israel, and the impression produced by that restoration is for them
          a signal, though not perhaps a complete,<a id="noteref_185" name=

          who hover on the outskirts of civilisation, are not touched by this
          revelation of the divine power and goodness; they seem to be
          represented as utterly ignorant of the marvellous course of events
          by which Israel has been brought to dwell securely in the midst of

          These, accordingly, are reserved for a final reckoning, in which

            3-9.—The prophet having been commanded to direct his face towards
            Gog in the land of Magog, is commissioned to announce the fate
            that is in store for him and his hosts in the latter days. The
            name of this mysterious and formidable personage was evidently
            familiar to the Jewish world of Ezekiel's time, although to us
            its origin is altogether obscure. The most plausible suggestion,
            on the whole, is perhaps that which identifies it with the name
            of the Lydian monarch Gyges, which appears on the Assyrian
            monuments in the form <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Gugu</span></span>, corresponding as closely

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">189</span></span></a> But
            in the mind of Ezekiel Gog is hardly an historical figure. He is
            but the impersonation of the dreaded power of the northern
            barbarians, already recognised as a serious danger to the peace
            of the world. His designation as prince of Rosh, Meshech, and
            Tubal points to the region east of the Black Sea as the seat of
            his power.<a id="noteref_190" name="noteref_190" href=

            is the captain of a vast multitude of horsemen, gorgeously
            arrayed, and armed with shield, helmet, and sword. But although
            Gog himself belongs to the <span class="tei tei-q">“uttermost
            north,”</span> he gathers under his banner all the most distant
            nations both of the north and the south. Not only northern

            shield and helmet, swell the ranks of his motley army. The name
            of Gog is thus on the way to become a symbol of the implacable
            enmity of this world to the kingdom of God; as in the book of the
            Revelation it appears as the designation of the ungodly
            world-power which perishes in conflict with the saints of God
            (Rev. xx. 7 ff.).</p>

            bring them up against the mountains of Israel, now reclaimed from
            desolation, and against a nation gathered from among many
            peoples, dwelling in peace and security. The advance of these
            destructive hordes is likened to a tempest, and their innumerable
            multitude is pictured as a cloud covering all the land (ver.
            9).</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">ii. Vv.
            10-16.—But like the Assyrian in the time of Isaiah, Gog
            <span class="tei tei-q">“meaneth not so”</span>; he is not aware
            that he is Jehovah's instrument, his purpose being to

            Hence the prophet proceeds to a new description of the enterprise
            of Gog, laying stress on the <span class="tei tei-q">“evil
            thought”</span> that will arise in his heart and lure him to his
            doom. What urges him on is the lust of plunder. The report of the
            people of Israel as a people that has amassed wealth and
            substance, and is at the same time defenceless, dwelling in a
            land without <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page371">[pg

            walls or bolts or gates, will have reached him. These two verses
            (11, 12) are interesting as giving a picture of Ezekiel's
            conception of the final state of the people of God. They dwell in
            the <span class="tei tei-q">“navel of the world”</span>; they are
            rich and prosperous, so that the fame of them has gone forth
            through all lands; they are destitute of military resources, yet
            are unmolested in the enjoyment of their favoured lot because of
            the moral effect of Jehovah's name on all nations that know their
            history. To Gog, however, who knows nothing of Jehovah, they will
            seem an easy conquest, and he will come up confident of victory
            to seize spoil and take booty and lay his hand on waste places
            reinhabited and a people gathered out of the heathen. The news of
            the great expedition and the certainty of its success will rouse
            the cupidity of the trading communities from all the ends of the
            earth, and they will attach themselves as camp-followers to the
            army of Gog. In historic times this <span class=
            "tei tei-foreign"><span style=

            Ezekiel is thinking of a time when Tyre shall be no more; and its
            place is taken by the mercantile tribes of Arabia and the ancient
            Phœnician colony of Tarshish. The whole world will then resound
            with the fame of Gog's expedition, and the most distant nations
            will await its issue with eager expectation. This then is the
            meaning of Gog's destiny. In the time when Israel dwells

            multitudes will be set in motion, and throw themselves on the

            the purpose of it is that the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

            17-23.—These verses are in the main a description of the
            annihilation of Gog's host by the fierce wrath of Jehovah; but
            this is introduced by a reference to unfulfilled prophecies which
            are to receive their accomplishment in this great catastrophe. It
            is difficult to say what particular prophecies are meant. Those
            which most readily suggest themselves are perhaps the fourth
            chapter of Joel and the twelfth and fourteenth of Zechariah; but
            these probably belong to a later date than Ezekiel. The
            prophecies of Zephaniah and Jeremiah, called forth by the
            Scythian invasion,<a id="noteref_198" name="noteref_198" href=
            "#note_198"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">198</span></span></a>
            have also been thought of, although the point of view there is
            different from that of Ezekiel. In Jeremiah and Zephaniah the
            Scythians are the scourge of God, appointed for the chastisement
            of the sinful nation; whereas Gog is brought up against a holy
            people, and for the express purpose of having judgment executed
            on himself. On the supposition that Ezekiel's vision was coloured
            by his recollection of the Scythians, this view has no doubt the
            greatest likelihood. It is possible, however, that the allusion
            is not to any particular group of prophecies, but to a general
            idea which pervades prophecy—the expectation of a great conflict
            in which the power of the world shall be arrayed against Jehovah
            and Israel, and the issue of which shall exhibit the sole
            sovereignty of the true God to all mankind.<a id="noteref_199"

            is of course unnecessary to suppose that any prophet had
            mentioned Gog by name in a prediction of the future. All that is
            meant is that Gog is the person in whom the substance of previous
            oracles is to be accomplished.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The question
            of ver. 17 leads thus to the announcement of the outpouring of
            Jehovah's indignation on the violators of His territory. As soon
            as Gog sets foot on the soil of Israel, Jehovah's wrath is
            kindled against him. A mighty earthquake shall shatter the
            mountains and level every wall to the ground and strike terror
            into the hearts of all creatures. The host of Gog shall be
            panic-stricken,<a id="noteref_200" name="noteref_200" href=

            each man turning his sword against his fellow; while Jehovah
            completes the slaughter by pestilence and blood, rain and
            hailstones, fire and brimstone. The deliverance of Israel is
            effected without the help of any human arm; it is the doing of
            Jehovah, who thus magnifies and sanctifies Himself and makes
            Himself known before the eyes of many peoples, so that they may
            know Him to be Jehovah.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">iv. Ch. xxxix.
            1-8.—Commencing afresh with a new apostrophe to Gog, Ezekiel here
            recapitulates the substance of the previous chapter—the bringing
            up of Gog from the farthest north, his destruction on the
            mountains of Israel, and the effect of this on the surrounding
            nations. Mention is expressly made of the bow and arrows which
            were the distinctive weapons of the Scythian horsemen.<a id=

            These are struck from the grasp of Gog, and the mighty host falls
            on the open field to be devoured by wild beasts and by ravenous
            birds of every feather. But the judgment is universal in its
            extent; it reaches to Magog, the distant abode of Gog, and all
            the remote lands whence his auxiliaries were drawn. This is the
            day whereof Jehovah has spoken by His servants the prophets of
            Israel, the day which finally manifests His glory to all the ends
            of the earth.</p>

            proceeds to describe with characteristic <span class="tei tei-pb"

            invasion. As the English story of the Invincible Armada would be
            incomplete without a reference to the treasures cast ashore from
            the wrecked galleons on the Orkneys and the Hebrides, so the fate
            of Gog's ill-starred enterprise is vividly set forth by the
            minute description of the traces it left behind in the peaceful
            life of Israel. The irony of the situation is unmistakable, and
            perhaps a touch of conscious exaggeration is permissible in such
            a picture. In the first place the weapons of the slain warriors
            furnish wood enough to serve for fuel to the Israelites for the
            space of seven years. Then follows a picture of the process of
            cleansing the land from the corpses of the fallen enemy. A
            burying-place is assigned to them in the valley of Abarim<a id=

            the eastern side of the Dead Sea, outside of the sacred
            territory. The whole people of Israel will be engaged for seven
            months in the operation of burying them; after this the mouth of
            the valley will be sealed,<a id="noteref_203" name="noteref_203"

            it will be known ever afterwards as the Valley of the Host of
            Gog. But even after the seven months have expired the scrupulous
            care of the people for the purity of their land will be shown by
            the precautions they take against its continued defilement by any
            fragment of a skeleton that may have been overlooked. They will
            appoint permanent officials, whose business will be to search for
            and remove relics of the dead bodies, that the land may be
            restored to its purity. Whenever any <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">vi. Vv.
            17-24.—The overwhelming magnitude of the catastrophe is once more
            set forth under the image of a sacrificial feast, to which
            Jehovah summons all the birds of the air and every beast of the
            field (vv. 17-20). The feast is represented as a sacrifice not in
            any religious sense, but simply in accordance with ancient usage,
            in which the slaughtering of animals was invariably a sacrificial
            act. The only idea expressed by the figure is that Jehovah has
            decreed this slaughter of Gog and his host, and that it will be
            so great that all ravenous beasts and birds will eat flesh to the
            full and drink the blood of princes of the earth to intoxication.
            But we turn with relief from these images of carnage and death to
            the moral purpose which they conceal (vv. 21-24). This is stated
            more distinctly here than in earlier passages of this prophecy.
            It will teach Israel that Jehovah is indeed their God; the
            lingering sense of insecurity caused by the remembrance of their
            former rejection will be finally taken away by this signal
            deliverance. And through Israel it will teach a lesson to the
            heathen. They will learn something of the principles on which
            Jehovah has dealt with His people when they contrast this great
            salvation with His former desertion of them. It will then fully
            appear that it was for their sins that they went into captivity;
            and so the knowledge of God's holiness and His displeasure
            against sin will be extended to the nations of the world.</p>

            25-29.—The closing verses do not strictly belong to the oracle on
            Gog. The prophet returns to the standpoint of the present, and
            predicts once more the restoration of Israel, which has
            heretofore been assumed as an accomplished fact. The connection
            with what precedes is, however, very close. The divine
            attributes, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page376">[pg

            far-off day of Gog's defeat, are already about to be revealed to
            Israel. Jehovah's compassion for His people and His jealousy for
            His own name will speedily be shown in <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“turning the fortunes”</span> of Israel, bringing
            them back from the peoples, and gathering them from the land of
            their enemies. The consequences of this upon the nation itself
            are described in more gracious terms than in any other passage.
            They shall forget their shame and all their trespasses when they
            dwell securely in their own land, none making them afraid.<a id=

            thinking. We must now try to form an estimate of its significance
            as an episode in the great drama of Providence which unfolded
            itself before his inspired imagination.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The ideas
            peculiar to the passage are for the most part <span class=

            "Pg377" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> such as might have been
            suggested to the mind of Ezekiel by the remembrance of the great
            Scythian invasion in the reign of Josiah. Although it is not
            likely that he had himself lived through that time of terror, he
            must have grown up whilst it was still fresh in the public
            recollection, and the rumour of it had apparently left upon him
            impressions never afterwards effaced. Several circumstances, none
            of them perhaps decisive by itself, conspire to show that at
            least in its imagery the oracle on Gog is based on the conception
            of an irruption of Scythian barbarians. The name of Gog may be
            too obscure to serve as an indication; but his location in the
            extreme north, the description of his army as composed mainly of
            cavalry armed with bow and arrows, their innumerable multitude,
            and the love of pillage and destruction by which they are
            animated, all point to the Scythians as the originals from whom
            the picture of Gog's host is drawn. Besides the light which it
            casts on the genesis of the prophecy, this fact has a certain
            biographical interest for the reader of Ezekiel. That the
            prophet's furthest vista into the future should be a reflection
            of his earliest memory reminds us of a common human experience.

            merely the imagery of the prophecy that reveals the influence of
            these early associations; the thoughts which it embodies are
            themselves partly the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page378">[pg
            378]</span><a name="Pg378" id="Pg378" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            result of the prophet's meditation on questions suggested by the
            invasion. His youthful impressions of the descent of the northern
            hordes were afterwards illuminated, as we see from his own words,
            by the study of contemporary prophecies of Jeremiah and Zephaniah
            called forth by the event. From these and other predictions he
            learned that Jehovah had a purpose with regard to the remotest
            nations of the earth which yet awaited its accomplishment. That
            purpose, in accordance with his general conception of the ends of
            the divine government, could be nothing else than the
            manifestation of Jehovah's glory before the eyes of the world.
            That this involved an act of judgment was only too certain from
            the universal hostility of the heathen to the kingdom of God.
            Hence the prophet's reflections would lead directly to the
            expectation of a final onslaught of the powers of this world on
            the people of Israel, which would give occasion for a display of
            Jehovah's might on a grander scale than had yet been seen. And
            this presentiment of an impending conflict between Jehovah and
            the pagan world headed by the Scythian barbarians forms the
            kernel of the oracle against Gog.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But we must
            further observe that this idea, from Ezekiel's point of view,
            necessarily presupposes the restoration of Israel to its own
            land. The peoples assembled under the standard of Gog are those
            which have never as yet come in contact with the true God, and
            consequently have had no opportunity of manifesting their
            disposition towards Him. They have not sinned as Edom and Tyre,
            as Egypt and Assyria have sinned, by injuries done to Jehovah
            through His people. Even the Scythians themselves, although they
            had approached the confines of the sacred territory, do not seem
            to have invaded it. Nor could the opportunity present itself so
            long as Israel was in Exile. While Jehovah was without
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page379">[pg 379]</span><a name=
            "Pg379" id="Pg379" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> an earthly
            sanctuary or a visible emblem of His government, there was no
            possibility of such an infringement of His holiness on the part
            of the heathen as would arrest the attention of the world. The
            judgment of Gog, therefore, could not be conceived as a
            preliminary to the restoration of Israel, like that on Egypt and
            the nations immediately surrounding Palestine. It could only take
            place under a state of things in which Israel was once more
            <span class="tei tei-q">“holiness to the Lord, and the
            firstfruits of His increase,”</span> so that <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“all that devoured him were counted guilty”</span>
            (Jer. ii. 3). This enables us partly to understand what appears
            to us the most singular feature of the prophecy, the projection
            of the final manifestation of Jehovah into the remote future,
            when Israel is already in possession of all the blessings of the
            Messianic dispensation. It is a consequence of the extension of
            the prophetic horizon, so as to embrace the distant peoples that
            had hitherto been beyond the pale of civilisation.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are
            other aspects of Ezekiel's teaching on which light is thrown by
            this anticipation of a world-judgment as the final scene of
            history. The prophet was evidently conscious of a certain
            inconclusiveness and want of finality in the prospect of the
            restoration as a justification of the ways of God to men.
            Although all the forces of the world's salvation were wrapped up
            in it, its effects were still limited and measurable, both as to
            their range of influence and their inherent significance. Not
            only did it fail to impress the more distant nations, but its own
            lessons were incompletely taught. He felt that it had not been
            made clear to the dull perceptions of the heathen why the God of
            Israel had ever suffered His land to be desecrated and His people
            to be led into captivity. Even Israel itself will not fully know
            all that is meant by having Jehovah for its God until the history
            of revelation is finished. Only in the summing up of the ages,
            and in the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page380">[pg
            380]</span><a name="Pg380" id="Pg380" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            light of the last judgment, will men truly realise all that is
            implied in the terms God and sin and redemption. The end is
            needed to interpret the process; and all religious conceptions
            await their fulfilment in the light of eternity which is yet to
            break on the issues of human history.</p>

          Vision.</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have now
          reached the last and in every way the most important section of the
          book of Ezekiel. The nine concluding chapters record what was
          evidently the crowning experience of the prophet's life. His
          ministry began with a vision of God; it culminates in a vision of
          the people of God, or rather of God in the midst of His people,
          reconciled to them, ruling over them, and imparting the blessings
          and glories of the final dispensation. Into that vision are thrown
          the ideals which had been gradually matured through twenty years of
          strenuous action and intense meditation. We have traced some of the
          steps by which the prophet was led towards this consummation of his
          work. We have seen how, under the idea of God which had been
          revealed to him, he was constrained to announce the destruction of
          that which called itself the people of Jehovah, but was in reality
          the means of obscuring His character and profaning His holiness
          (chs. iv.-xxiv.). We have seen further how the same fundamental
          conception led him on in his prophecies against foreign nations to
          predict a great clearing of the stage of history for the
          manifestation of Jehovah (chs. xxv.-xxxii.). And we have seen from
          the preceding section what are the processes by which the divine
          Spirit breathes new life into a dead nation and creates out of its
          scattered members a people worthy of the God whom the prophet has
          seen.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But there is
          still something more to accomplish before <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page384">[pg 384]</span><a name="Pg384" id="Pg384" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> his task is finished. All through, Ezekiel
          holds fast the truth that Jehovah and Israel are necessarily
          related to each other, and that Israel is to be the medium through
          which alone the nature of Jehovah can be fully disclosed to
          mankind. It remains, therefore, to sketch the outline of a perfect
          theocracy—in other words, to describe the permanent forms and
          institutions which shall express the ideal relation between God and
          men. To this task the prophet addresses himself in the chapters now
          before us. That great New Year's Vision may be regarded as the ripe
          fruit of all God's training of His prophet, as it is also the part
          of Ezekiel's work which most directly influenced the subsequent
          development of religion in Israel.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It cannot be
          doubted, then, that these chapters are an integral part of the
          book, considered as a record of Ezekiel's work. But it is certainly
          a significant circumstance that they are separated from the body of
          the prophecies by an interval of thirteen years. For the greater
          part of that time Ezekiel's literary activity was suspended. It is
          probable, at all events, that the first thirty-nine chapters had
          been committed to writing soon after the latest date they mention,
          and that the oracle on Gog, which marks the extreme limit of
          Ezekiel's prophetic vision, was really the conclusion of an earlier
          form of the book. And we may be certain that, since the eventful
          period that followed the arrival of the fugitive from Jerusalem, no
          new divine communication had visited the prophet's mind. But at
          last, in the twenty-fifth year of the captivity, and on the first
          day of a new year,<a id="noteref_205" name="noteref_205" href=
          "#note_205"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">205</span></span></a> he
          falls into a trance more prolonged than any he had yet <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page385">[pg 385]</span><a name="Pg385" id="Pg385"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> passed through, and he emerged from it
          with a new message for his people.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In what
          direction were the prophet's thoughts moving as Israel passed into
          the midnight of her exile? That they have moved in the
          interval—that his standpoint is no longer quite identical with that
          represented in his earlier prophecies—seems to be shown by one
          slight modification of his previous conceptions, which has been
          already mentioned.<a id="noteref_206" name="noteref_206" href=
          "#note_206"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">206</span></span></a> I
          refer to the position of the prince in the theocratic state. We
          find that the king is still the civil head of the commonwealth, but
          that his position is hardly reconcilable with the exalted functions
          assigned to the Messianic king in ch. xxxiv. The inference seems
          irresistible that Ezekiel's point of view has somewhat changed, so
          that the objects in his picture present themselves in a different
          perspective.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is true that
          this change was effected by a vision, and it may be said that that
          fact forbids our regarding it as indicating a progress in Ezekiel's
          thoughts. But the vision of a prophet is never out of relation to
          his previous thinking. The prophet is always prepared for his
          vision; it comes to him as the answer to questions, as the solution
          of difficulties, whose force he has felt, and apart from which it
          would convey no revelation of God to his mind. It marks the point
          at which reflection gives place to inspiration, where the
          incommunicable certainty of the divine word lifts the soul into the
          region of spiritual and eternal truth. And hence it may help us,
          from our human point of view, to understand the true import of this
          vision, if from the answer we try to discover the questions which
          were of pressing interest to Ezekiel in the later part of his
          career.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Speaking
          generally, we may say that the problem that <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page386">[pg 386]</span><a name="Pg386" id="Pg386"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> occupied the mind of Ezekiel at this
          time was the problem of a religious constitution. How to secure for
          religion its true place in public life, how to embody it in
          institutions which shall conserve its essential ideas and transmit
          them from one generation to another, how a people may best express
          its national responsibility to God—these and many kindred questions
          are real and vital to-day amongst the nations of Christendom, and
          they were far more vital in the age of Ezekiel. The conception of
          religion as an inward spiritual power, moulding the life of the
          nation and of each individual member, was at least as strong in him
          as in any other prophet; and it had been adequately expressed in
          the section of his book dealing with the formation of the new
          Israel. But he saw that this was not for that time sufficient. The
          mass of the community were dependent on the educative influence of
          the institutions under which they lived, and there was no way of
          impressing on a whole people the character of Jehovah except
          through a system of laws and observances which should constantly
          exhibit it to their minds. The time was not yet come when religion
          could be trusted to work as a hidden leaven, transforming life from
          within and bringing in the kingdom of God silently by the operation
          of spiritual forces. Thus, while the last section insists on the
          moral change that must pass over Israel, and the need of a direct
          influence from God on the heart of the people, that which now lies
          before us is devoted to the religious and political arrangements by
          which the sanctity of the nation must be preserved.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Starting from
          this general notion of what the prophet sought, we can see, in the
          next place, that his attention must be mainly concentrated on
          matters belonging to public worship and ritual. Worship is the
          direct expression in word and act of man's attitude to God, and no
          public religion can maintain a higher level of spirituality
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page387">[pg 387]</span><a name=
          "Pg387" id="Pg387" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> than the symbolism
          which gives it a place in the life of the people. That fact had
          been abundantly illustrated by the experience of centuries before
          the Exile. The popular worship had always been a stronghold of
          false religion in Israel. The high places were the nurseries of all
          the corruptions against which the prophets had to contend, not
          simply because of the immoral elements that mingled with their
          worship, but because the worship itself was regulated by
          conceptions of the deity which were opposed to the religion of
          revelation. Now the idea of using ritual as a vehicle of the
          highest spiritual truth is certainly not peculiar to Ezekiel's
          vision. But it is there carried through with a thoroughness which
          has no parallel elsewhere except in the priestly legislation of the
          Pentateuch. And this bears witness to a clear perception on the
          part of the prophet of the value of that whole side of things for
          the future development of religion in Israel. No one was more
          deeply impressed with the evils that had flowed from a corrupt
          ritual in the past, and he conceives the final form of the kingdom
          of God to be one in which the blessings of salvation are
          safeguarded by a carefully regulated system of religious
          ordinances. It will become manifest as we proceed that he regards
          the Temple ritual as the very centre of theocratic life, and the
          highest function of the community of the true religion.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But Ezekiel was
          prepared for the reception of this vision, not only by the
          practical reforming bent of his mind, but also by a combination in
          his own experience of the two elements which must always enter into
          a conception of this nature. If we may employ philosophical
          language to express a very obvious distinction, we have to
          recognise in the vision a material and a formal element. The matter
          of the vision is derived from the ancient religious and political
          constitution of the Hebrew state. All true and lasting reformations
          are conservative at heart; <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page388">[pg 388]</span><a name="Pg388" id="Pg388" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> their object never is to make a clean sweep
          of the past, but so to modify what is traditional as to adapt it to
          the needs of a new era. Now Ezekiel was a priest, and possessed all
          a priest's reverence for antiquity, as well as a priest's
          professional knowledge of ceremonial and of consuetudinary law. No
          man could have been better fitted than he to secure the continuity
          of Israel's religious life along the particular line on which it
          was destined to move. Accordingly we find that the new theocracy is
          modelled from beginning to end after the pattern of the ancient
          institutions which had been destroyed by the Exile. If we ask, for
          example, what is the meaning of some detail of the Temple building,
          such as the cells surrounding the main sanctuary, the obvious and
          sufficient answer is that these things existed in Solomon's Temple,
          and there was no reason for altering them. On the other hand,
          whenever we find the vision departing from what had been
          traditionally established, we may be sure that there is a reason
          for it, and in most cases we can see what that reason was. In such
          departures we recognise the working of what we have called the
          formal element of the vision, the moulding influence of the ideas
          which the system was intended to express. What these ideas were we
          shall consider in subsequent chapters; here it is enough to say
          that they were the fundamental ideas which had been communicated to
          Ezekiel in the course of his prophetic work, and which have found
          expression in various forms in other parts of his writings. That
          they are not peculiar to Ezekiel, but are shared by other prophets,
          is true, just as it is true on the other hand that the priestly
          conceptions which occupy so large a place in his mind were an
          inheritance from the whole past history of the nation. Nor was this
          the first time when an alliance between the ceremonialism of the
          priesthood and the more ethical and spiritual teaching of prophecy
          had proved of the utmost <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page389">[pg
          389]</span><a name="Pg389" id="Pg389" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          advantage to the religious life of Israel.<a id="noteref_207" name=
          "noteref_207" href="#note_207"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">207</span></span></a> The
          unique importance of Ezekiel's vision lies in the fact that the
          great development of prophecy was now almost complete, and that the
          time was come for its results to be embodied in institutions which
          were in the main of a priestly character. And it was fitting that
          this new era of religion should be inaugurated through the agency
          of one who combined in his own person the conservative instincts of
          the priest with the originality and the spiritual intuition of the
          prophet.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is not
          suggested for a moment that these considerations account for the
          inception of the vision in the prophet's mind. We are not to regard
          it as merely the brilliant device of an ingenious man, who was
          exceptionally qualified to read the signs of the times, and to
          discover a solution for a pressing religious problem. In order that
          it might accomplish the end in view, it was absolutely necessary
          that it should be invested with a supernatural sanction and bear
          the stamp of divine authority. Ezekiel himself was well aware of
          this, and would never have ventured to publish his vision if he had
          thought it all out for himself. He had to wait for the time when
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the hand of the Lord was upon him,”</span>
          and he saw in vision the new Temple and the river of life
          proceeding from it, and the renovated land, and the glory of God
          taking up its everlasting abode in the midst of His people. Until
          that moment arrived he was without a message as to the form which
          the life of the restored Israel must assume. Nevertheless the
          psychological conditions of the vision were contained in those
          parts of the prophet's experience which have just been indicated.
          Processes of thought which had long occupied his mind suddenly
          crystallised at the touch of the divine hand, and the result was
          the marvellous conception <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page390">[pg
          390]</span><a name="Pg390" id="Pg390" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          of a theocratic state which was Ezekiel's greatest legacy to the
          faith and hopes of his countrymen.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That this vision
          of Ezekiel's profoundly influenced the development of post-exilic
          Judaism may be inferred from the fact that all the best tendencies
          of the restoration period were towards the realisation of the
          ideals which the vision sets forth with surpassing clearness. It is
          impossible, indeed, to say precisely how far Ezekiel's influence
          extended, or how far the returning exiles consciously aimed at
          carrying out the ideas contained in his sketch of a theocratic
          constitution. That they did so to some extent is inferred from a
          consideration of some of the arrangements established in Jerusalem
          soon after the return from Babylon.<a id="noteref_208" name=
          "noteref_208" href="#note_208"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">208</span></span></a> But
          it is certain that from the nature of the case the actual
          institutions of the restored community must have differed very
          widely in many points from those described in the last nine
          chapters of Ezekiel. When we look more closely at the composition
          of this vision, we see that it contains features which neither then
          nor at any subsequent time have been historically fulfilled. The
          most remarkable thing about it is that it unites in one picture two
          characteristics which seem at first sight difficult to combine. On
          the one hand it bears the aspect of a rigid legislative system
          intended to regulate human conduct in all matters of vital moment
          to the religious standing of the community; on the other hand it
          assumes a miraculous transformation of the physical aspect of the
          country, a restoration of all the twelve tribes of Israel under a
          native king, and a return of Jehovah in visible glory to dwell in
          the midst of the children of Israel for ever. Now these
          supernatural conditions of the perfect theocracy could not be
          realised by any effort on the part of the people, and as a matter
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page391">[pg 391]</span><a name=
          "Pg391" id="Pg391" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of fact were never
          literally fulfilled at all. It must have been plain to the leaders
          of the Return that for this reason alone the details of Ezekiel's
          legislation were not binding for them in the actual circumstances
          in which they were placed. Even in matters clearly within the
          province of human administration we know that they considered
          themselves free to modify his regulations in accordance with the
          requirements of the situation in which they found themselves. It
          does not follow from this, however, that they were ignorant of the
          book of Ezekiel, or that it gave them no help in the difficult task
          to which they addressed themselves. It furnished them with an ideal
          of national holiness, and the general outline of a constitution in
          which that ideal should be embodied; and this outline they seem to
          have striven to fill up in the way best adapted to the straitened
          and discouraging circumstances of the time.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But this throws
          us back on some questions of fundamental importance for the right
          understanding of Ezekiel's vision. Taking the vision as a whole, we
          have to ask whether a fulfilment of the kind just indicated was the
          fulfilment that the prophet himself anticipated. Did he lay stress
          on the legislative or the supernatural aspect of the vision—on
          man's agency or on God's? In other words, does he issue it as a
          programme to be carried out by the people as soon as the
          opportunity is presented by their return to the land of Canaan? or
          does he mean that Jehovah Himself must take the initiative by
          miraculously preparing the land for their reception, and taking up
          His abode in the finished Temple, the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“place of His throne, and the place of the soles of His
          feet”</span>? The answer to these questions is not difficult, if
          only we are careful to look at things from the prophet's point of
          view, and disregard the historical events in which his predictions
          were partly realised. It is frequently assumed that the
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page392">[pg 392]</span><a name=
          "Pg392" id="Pg392" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> elaborate
          description of the Temple buildings in chs. xl.-xlii. is intended
          as a guide to the builders of the second Temple, who are to make it
          after the fashion of that which the prophet saw on the mount. It is
          quite probable that in some degree it may have served that purpose;
          but it seems to me that this view is not in keeping with the
          fundamental idea of the vision. The Temple that Ezekiel saw, and
          the only one of which he speaks, is a house not made with hands; it
          is as much a part of the supernatural preparation for the future
          theocracy as the <span class="tei tei-q">“very high
          mountain”</span> on which it stands, or the river that flows from
          it to sweeten the waters of the Dead Sea. In the important passage
          where the prophet is commanded to exhibit the plan of the house to
          the children of Israel (ch. xliii. 10, 11), there is unfortunately
          a discrepancy between the Hebrew and Greek texts which throws some
          obscurity on this particular point. According to the Hebrew there
          can hardly be a doubt that a sketch is shown to them which is to be
          used as a builder's plan at the time of the Restoration.<a id=
          "noteref_209" name="noteref_209" href="#note_209"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">209</span></span></a> But
          in the Septuagint, which seems on the whole to give a more correct
          text, the passage runs thus: <span class="tei tei-q">“And, thou son
          of man, describe the house to the house of Israel (and let them be
          ashamed of their iniquities), and its form, and its construction:
          and they shall be ashamed of all that they have done. And do thou
          sketch the house, and its exits, and its outline; and all its
          ordinances and all its laws make known to them; and write it before
          them, that they may keep all its commandments and all its
          ordinances, and do them.”</span> There is nothing here to suggest
          that the construction of the Temple was left for human workmanship.
          The outline of it is shown to the people only that they may
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page393">[pg 393]</span><a name=
          "Pg393" id="Pg393" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> be ashamed of all
          their iniquities. When the arrangements of the ideal Temple are
          explained to them, they will see how far those of the first Temple
          transgressed the requirements of Jehovah's holiness, and this
          knowledge will produce a sense of shame for the dulness of heart
          which tolerated so many abuses in connection with His worship. No
          doubt that impression sank deep into the minds of Ezekiel's
          hearers, and led to certain important modifications in the
          structure of the Temple when it had to be built; but that is not
          what the prophet is thinking of. At the same time we see clearly
          that he is very much in earnest with the legislative part of his
          vision. Its laws are real laws, and are given that they may be
          obeyed—only they do not come into force until all the institutions
          of the theocracy, natural and supernatural alike, are in full
          working order. And apart from the doubtful question as to the
          erection of the Temple, that general conclusion holds good for the
          vision as a whole. Whilst it is pervaded throughout by the
          legislative spirit, the miraculous features are after all its
          central and essential elements. When these conditions are realised,
          it will be the duty of Israel to guard her sacred institutions by
          the most scrupulous and devoted obedience; but till then there is
          no kingdom of God established on earth, and therefore no system of
          laws to conserve a state of salvation, which can only be brought
          about by the direct and visible interposition of the Almighty in
          the sphere of nature and history.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This blending of
          seemingly incongruous elements reveals to us the true character of
          the vision with which we have to deal. It is in the strictest sense
          a Messianic prophecy—that is, a picture of the kingdom of God in
          its final state as the prophet was led to conceive it. It is common
          to all such representations that the human authors of them have no
          idea of a long historical development gradually leading up to the
          perfect manifestation <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page394">[pg
          394]</span><a name="Pg394" id="Pg394" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          of God's purpose with the world. The impending crisis in the
          affairs of the people of Israel is always regarded as the
          consummation of human history and the establishment of God's
          kingdom in the plenitude of its power and glory. In the time of
          Ezekiel the next step in the unfolding of the divine plan of
          redemption was the restoration of Israel to its own land; and in so
          far as his vision is a prophecy of that event, it was realised in
          the return of the exiles with Zerubbabel in the first year of
          Cyrus. But to the mind of Ezekiel this did not present itself as a
          mere step towards something immeasurably higher in the remote
          future. It is to include everything necessary for the complete and
          final inbringing of the Messianic dispensation, and all the powers
          of the world to come are to be displayed in the acts by which
          Jehovah brings back the scattered members of Israel to the
          enjoyment of blessedness in His own presence.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The thing that
          misleads us as to the real nature of the vision is the emphasis
          laid on matters which seem to us of merely temporal and earthly
          significance. We are apt to think that what we have before us can
          be nothing else than a legislative scheme to be carried out more or
          less fully in the new state that should arise after the Exile. The
          miraculous features in the vision are apt to be dismissed as mere
          symbolisms to which no great significance attaches. Legislating for
          the millennium seems to us a strange occupation for a prophet, and
          we are hardly prepared to credit even Ezekiel with so bold a
          conception. But that depends entirely on his idea of what the
          millennium will be. If it is to be a state of things in which
          religious institutions are of vital importance for the maintenance
          of the spiritual interests of the community of the people of God,
          then legislation is the natural expression for the ideals which are
          to be realised in it. And we must remember, too, that what we have
          to do <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page395">[pg 395]</span><a name=
          "Pg395" id="Pg395" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> with is a vision.
          Ezekiel is not the ultimate source of this legislation, however
          much it may bear the impress of his individual experience. He has
          seen the city of God, and all the minute and elaborate regulations
          with which these nine chapters are filled are but the exposition of
          principles that determine the character of a people amongst whom
          Jehovah can dwell.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the same time
          we see that a separation of different aspects of the vision was
          inevitably effected by the teaching of history. The return from
          Babylon was accomplished without any of those supernatural adjuncts
          with which it had been invested in the rapt imagination of the
          prophet. No transformation of the land preceded it; no visible
          presence of Jehovah welcomed the exiles back to their ancient
          abode. They found Jerusalem in ruins, the holy and beautiful house
          a desolation, the land occupied by aliens, the seasons unproductive
          as of old. Yet in the hearts of these men there was a vision even
          more impressive than that of Ezekiel in his solitude. To lay the
          foundations of a theocratic state in the dreary, discouraging
          daylight of the present was an act of faith as heroic as has ever
          been performed in the history of religion. The building of the
          Temple was undertaken amidst many difficulties, the ritual was
          organised, the rudiments of a religious constitution appeared, and
          in all this we see the influence of those principles of national
          holiness that had been formulated by Ezekiel. But the crowning
          manifestation of Jehovah's glory was deferred. Prophet after
          prophet appeared to keep alive the hope that this Temple, poor in
          outward appearance as it was, would yet be the centre of a new
          world, and the dwelling-place of the Eternal. Centuries rolled
          past, and still Jehovah did not come to His Temple, and the
          eschatological features which had bulked so largely in Ezekiel's
          vision remained an unfulfilled aspiration. And when at <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page396">[pg 396]</span><a name="Pg396" id="Pg396"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> length in the fulness of time the
          complete revelation of God was given, it was in a form that
          superseded the old economy entirely, and transformed its most
          stable and cherished institutions into adumbrations of a spiritual
          kingdom which knew no earthly Temple and had need of none.</p>

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This brings us
          to the most difficult and most important of all the questions
          arising in connection with Ezekiel's vision—What is its relation to
          the Pentateuchal Legislation? It is obvious at once that the
          significance of this section of the book of Ezekiel is immensely
          enhanced if we accept the conclusion to which the critical study of
          the Old Testament has been steadily driven, that in the chapters
          before us we have the first outline of that great conception of a
          theocratic constitution which attained its finished expression in
          the priestly regulations of the middle books of the Pentateuch. The
          discussion of this subject is so intricate, so far-reaching in its
          consequences, and ranges over so wide an historical field, that one
          is tempted to leave it in the hands of those who have addressed
          themselves to its special treatment, and to try to get on as best
          one may without assuming a definite attitude on one side or the
          other. But the student of Ezekiel cannot altogether evade it. Again
          and again the question will force itself on him as he seeks to
          ascertain the meaning of the various details of Ezekiel's
          legislation, How does this stand related to corresponding
          requirements in the Mosaic law? It is necessary, therefore, in
          justice to the reader of the following pages, that an attempt
          should be made, however imperfectly, to indicate the position which
          the present phase of criticism assigns to Ezekiel in the history of
          the Old Testament legislation.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We may begin by
          pointing out the kind of difficulty that is felt to arise on the
          supposition that Ezekiel had <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page397">[pg 397]</span><a name="Pg397" id="Pg397" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> before him the entire body of laws contained
          in our present Pentateuch. We should expect in that case that the
          prophet would contemplate a restoration of the divine institutions
          established under Moses, and that his vision would reproduce with
          substantial fidelity the minute provisions of the law by which
          these institutions were to be maintained. But this is very far from
          being the case. It is found that while Ezekiel deals to a large
          extent with the subjects for which provision is made by the law,
          there is in no instance perfect correspondence between the
          enactments of the vision and those of the Pentateuch, while on some
          points they differ very materially from one another. How are we to
          account for these numerous and, on the supposition, evidently
          designed divergencies? It has been suggested that the law was found
          to be in some respects unsuitable to the state of things that would
          arise after the Exile, and that Ezekiel in the exercise of his
          prophetic authority undertook to adapt it to the conditions of a
          late age. The suggestion is in itself plausible, but it is not
          confirmed by the history. For it is agreed on all hands that the
          law as a whole had never been put in force for any considerable
          period of Israel's history previous to the Exile. On the other
          hand, if we suppose that Ezekiel judged its provisions unsuitable
          for the circumstances that would emerge after the Exile, we are
          confronted by the fact that where Ezekiel's legislation differs
          from that of the Pentateuch it is the latter and not the former
          that regulated the practice of the post-exilic community. So far
          was the law from being out of date in the age of Ezekiel that the
          time was only approaching when the first effort would be made to
          accept it in all its length and breadth as the authoritative basis
          of an actual theocratic polity. Unless, therefore, we are to hold
          that the legislation of the vision is entirely in the air, and that
          it takes no account whatever of practical considerations,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page398">[pg 398]</span><a name=
          "Pg398" id="Pg398" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> we must feel that a
          certain difficulty is presented by its unexplained deviations from
          the carefully drawn ordinances of the Pentateuch.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But this is not
          all. The Pentateuch itself is not a unity. It consists of different
          strata of legislation which, while irreconcilable in details, are
          held to exhibit a continuous progress towards a clearer definition
          of the duties that devolve on different classes in the community,
          and a fuller exposition of the principles that underlay the system
          from the beginning. The analysis of the Mosaic writings into
          different legislative codes has resulted in a scheme which in its
          main outlines is now accepted by critics of all shades of opinion.
          The three great codes which we have to distinguish are: (1) the
          so-called Book of the Covenant (Exod. xx. 24-xxiii., with which may
          be classed the closely allied code of Exod. xxxiv. 10-28); (2) the
          Book of Deuteronomy; and (3) the Priestly Code (found in Exod.
          xxv.-xxxi., xxxv.-xl., the whole book of Leviticus, and nearly the
          whole of the book of Numbers).<a id="noteref_210" name=
          "noteref_210" href="#note_210"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">210</span></span></a> Now
          of course the mere separation of these different documents tells us
          nothing, or not much, as to their relative priority or antiquity.
          But we possess at least a certain amount of historical and
          independent evidence as to the times when some of them became
          operative in the actual life of the nation. We know, for example,
          that the Book of Deuteronomy attained the force of statute law
          under the most solemn circumstances by a national covenant in the
          eighteenth year of Josiah. The distinctive feature of that book is
          its impressive enforcement of the principle that there is but one
          sanctuary at <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page399">[pg
          399]</span><a name="Pg399" id="Pg399" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          which Jehovah can be legitimately worshipped. When we compare the
          list of reforms carried out by Josiah, as given in the twenty-third
          chapter of 2 Kings, with the provisions of Deuteronomy, we see that
          it must have been that book and it alone that had been found in the
          Temple and that governed the reforming policy of the king. Before
          that time the law of the one sanctuary, if it was known at all, was
          certainly more honoured in the breach than the observance.
          Sacrifices were freely offered at local altars throughout the
          country, not merely by the ignorant common people and idolatrous
          kings, but by men who were the inspired religious leaders and
          teachers of the nation. Not only so, but this practice is
          sanctioned by the Book of the Covenant, which permits the erection
          of an altar in every place where Jehovah causes His name to be
          remembered, and only lays down injunctions as to the kind of altar
          that might be used (Exod. xx. 24-26). The evidence is thus very
          strong that the Book of Deuteronomy, at whatever time it may have
          been written, had not the force of public law until the year 621
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, and that down to
          that time the accepted and authoritative expression of the divine
          will for Israel was the law embraced in the Book of the
          Covenant.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To find similar
          evidence of the practical adoption of the Priestly Code we have to
          come down to a much later period. It is not till the year 444
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, in the time of Ezra
          and Nehemiah, that we read of the people pledging themselves by a
          solemn covenant to the observance of regulations which are clearly
          those of the finished system of Pentateuchal law (Neh. viii.-x.).
          It is there expressly stated that this law had not been observed in
          Israel up to that time (Neh. ix. 34), and in particular that the
          great Feast of Tabernacles had not been celebrated in accordance
          with the requirements of the law since the days of Joshua (Neh.
          viii. 17). This is quite conclusive as to <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page400">[pg 400]</span><a name="Pg400" id="Pg400" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> actual practice in Israel; and the fact that
          the observance of the law was thus introduced by instalments and on
          occasions of epoch-making importance in the history of the
          community raises a strong presumption against the hypothesis that
          the Pentateuch was an inseparable literary unity which must be
          known in its entirety where it was known at all.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now the date of
          Ezekiel's vision (572) lies between these two historic
          transactions—the inauguration of the law of Deuteronomy in 621, and
          that of the Priestly Code in 444; and in spite of the ideal
          character which belongs to the vision as a whole, it contains a
          system of legislation which admits of being compared point by point
          with the provisions of the other two codes on a variety of subjects
          common to all three. Some of the results of this comparison will
          appear as we proceed with the exposition of the chapters before us.
          But it will be convenient to state here the important conclusion to
          which a number of critics have been led by discussion of this
          question. It is held that Ezekiel's legislation represents on the
          whole a transition from the law of Deuteronomy to the more complex
          system of the Priestly document. The three codes exhibit a regular
          progression, the determining factor of which is a growing sense of
          the importance of the Temple worship and of the necessity for a
          careful regulation of the acts which express the religious standing
          and privileges of the community. On such matters as the feasts, the
          sacrifices, the distinction between priests and Levites, the Temple
          dues, and the provision for the maintenance of ordinances, it is
          found that Ezekiel lays down enactments which go beyond those of
          Deuteronomy and anticipate a further development in the same
          direction in the Levitical legislation.<a id="noteref_211" name=

          "Pg401" id="Pg401" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> The legislation of
          Ezekiel is accordingly regarded as a first step towards the
          codification of the ritual laws which regulated the usage of the
          first Temple. It is not of material consequence to know how far
          these laws had been already committed to writing, or how far they
          had been transmitted by oral tradition. The important point is that
          down to the time of Ezekiel the great body of ritual law had been
          the possession of the priests, who communicated it to the people in
          the shape of particular decisions as occasion demanded. Even the
          book of Deuteronomy, except on one or two points, such as the law
          of leprosy and of clean and unclean animals, does not encroach on
          matters of ritual, which it was the special province of the
          priesthood to administer. But now that the time was drawing near
          when the Temple and its worship were to be the very centre of the
          religious life of the nation, it was necessary that the essential
          elements of the ceremonial law should be systematised and published
          in a form understood of the people. The last nine chapters of
          Ezekiel, then, contain the first draft of such a scheme, drawn from
          an ancient priestly tradition which in its origin went back to the
          time of Moses. It is true that this was not the precise form in
          which the law was destined to be put in practice in the post-exilic
          community. But Ezekiel's legislation served its purpose when it
          laid down clearly, with the authority of a prophet, the fundamental
          ideas that underlie the conception of ritual as an aid to spiritual
          religion. And these ideas were not lost sight of, though it was
          reserved for others, working under the impulse supplied by Ezekiel,
          to perfect the details of the system, and to adopt the principles
          of the vision to the actual circumstances of the second Temple.
          Through what subsequent stages the work was carried we can hardly
          hope to determine with exactitude; but it was finished in all
          essential respects <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page402">[pg
          402]</span><a name="Pg402" id="Pg402" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          before the great covenant of Ezra and Nehemiah in the year
          444.<a id="noteref_212" name="noteref_212" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Let us now
          consider the bearing of this theory on the interpretation of
          Ezekiel's vision. It enables us to do justice to the unmistakable
          practical purpose which pervades its legislation. It frees us from
          the grave difficulties involved in the assumption that Ezekiel
          wrote with the finished Pentateuch before him. It vindicates the
          prophet from the suspicion of arbitrary deviations from a standard
          of venerable antiquity and of divine authority which was afterwards
          proved by experience to be suited to the requirements of that
          restored Israel in whose interest Ezekiel legislated. And in doing
          so it gives a new meaning to his claim to speak as a prophet
          ordaining a new system of laws with divine authority. Whilst
          perfectly consistent with the inspiration of the Mosaic books, it
          places that of Ezekiel on a surer footing than does the supposition
          that the whole Pentateuch was of Mosaic authorship. It involves, no
          doubt, that the details of the Priestly law <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page403">[pg 403]</span><a name="Pg403" id="Pg403"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> were in a more or less fluid condition
          down to the time of the Exile; but it explains the otherwise
          unaccountable fact that the several parts of the law became
          operative at different times in Israel's history, and explains it
          in a manner that reveals the working of a divine purpose through
          all the ages of the national existence. It becomes possible to see
          that Ezekiel's legislation and that of the Levitical books are in
          their essence alike Mosaic, as being founded on the institutions
          and principles established by Moses at the beginning of the
          nation's history. And an altogether new interest is imparted to the
          former when we learn to regard it as an epoch-making contribution
          to the task which laid the foundation of the post-exilic
          theocracy—the task of codifying and consolidating the laws which
          expressed the character of the new nation as a holy people
          consecrated to the service of Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The fundamental
          idea of the theocracy as conceived by Ezekiel is the literal
          dwelling of Jehovah in the midst of His people. The Temple is in
          the first instance Jehovah's palace, where He manifests His
          gracious presence by receiving the gifts and homage of His
          subjects. But the enjoyment of this privilege of access to the
          presence of God depends on the fulfilment of certain conditions
          which, in the prophet's view, had been systematically violated in
          the arrangements that prevailed under the first Temple. Hence the
          vision of Ezekiel is essentially the vision of a Temple
          corresponding in all respects to the requirements of Jehovah's
          holiness, and then of Jehovah's entrance into the house so prepared
          for His reception. And the first step towards the realisation of
          the great hope of the future was to lay before the exiles a full
          description of this building, so that they might understand the
          conditions on which alone Israel could be restored to its own
          land.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To this task the
          prophet addresses himself in the first four of the chapters before
          us, and he executes it in a manner which, considering the great
          technical difficulties to be surmounted, must excite our
          admiration. He tells us first in a brief introduction how he was
          transported in prophetic ecstasy to the land of Israel, and there
          on the site of the old Temple, now elevated into a <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“very high <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page405">[pg
          405]</span><a name="Pg405" id="Pg405" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          mountain,”</span> he sees before him an imposing pile of buildings
          like the building of a city (ver. 2). It is the future Temple, the
          city itself having been removed nearly two miles to the south. At
          the east gate he is met by an angel, who conducts him from point to
          point of the buildings, calling his attention to significant
          structural details, and measuring each part as he goes along with a
          measuring-line which he carries in his hand. It is probable that
          the whole description would be perfectly intelligible but for the
          state of the text, which is defective throughout and in some places
          hopelessly corrupt. This is hardly surprising when we consider the
          technical and unfamiliar nature of the terms employed; but it has
          been suspected that some parts have been deliberately tampered with
          in order to bring them into harmony with the actual construction of
          the second Temple. Whether that is so or not, the description as a
          whole remains in its way a masterpiece of literary exposition, and
          a remarkable proof of the versatility of Ezekiel's accomplishments.
          When it is necessary to turn himself into an architectural
          draughtsman he discharges the duty to perfection. No one can study
          the detailed measurements of the buildings without being convinced
          that the prophet is working from a ground plan which he has himself
          prepared; indeed his own words leave no doubt that this was the
          case (see ch. xliii. 10, 11). And it is a convincing demonstration
          of his descriptive powers that we are able, after the labours of
          many generations of scholars, to reproduce this plan with a
          certainty which, except with regard to a few minor features, leaves
          little to be desired. It has been remarked as a curious fact that
          of the three temples mentioned in the Old Testament the only one of
          whose construction we can form a clear conception is the one that
          was never built;<a id="noteref_213" name="noteref_213" href=
          "#note_213"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">213</span></span></a> and
          certainly the knowledge we have of Solomon's Temple <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page406">[pg 406]</span><a name="Pg406" id="Pg406"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> from the first book of Kings is very
          incomplete compared with what we know of the Temple which Ezekiel
          saw only in vision.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is impossible
          in this chapter to enter into all the minutiæ of the description,
          or even to discuss all the difficulties of interpretation which
          arise in connection with different parts. Full information on these
          points will be found in short compass in Dr. Davidson's commentary
          on the passage. All that can be attempted here is to convey a
          general idea of the arrangements of the various buildings and
          courts of the sanctuary, and the extreme care with which they have
          been thought out by the prophet. After this has been done we shall
          try to discover the meaning of these arrangements in so far as they
          differ from the model supplied by the first Temple.</p>

            this fact gives a better idea than anything else of the
            symmetrical structure of the Temple and of the absolute accuracy
            of the measurements.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sides of
            the large square represent of course the outer boundary of the
            enclosure, which is formed by a wall six cubits thick and six
            high.<a id="noteref_216" name="noteref_216" href=
            "#note_216"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

            sides are directed to the four points of the compass, and at the
            middle of the north, east and south sides the wall is pierced by
            the three gates, each with an ascent of seven steps outside. The
            gates, however, are not mere openings in the wall furnished with
            doors, but covered gateways similar to those that penetrate the
            thick wall of a fortified town. In this case they are large
            separate buildings projecting into the court to a distance of
            fifty cubits, and twenty-five cubits broad, exactly half the size
            of the Temple proper. On either side of the passage are three
            recesses in the wall six cubits square, which were to be used as
            guard-rooms by the Temple police. Each gateway terminates towards
            the court in a large hall called <span class="tei tei-q">“the
            porch,”</span> eight cubits broad (along the line of entry) by
            twenty long (across): the porch of the east gate was reserved for
            the use of the prince; the purpose of the other two is nowhere
            specified.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Passing
            through the eastern gateway, the prophet stands in the outer
            court of the Temple, the place where the people assembled for
            worship. It seems to have been entirely destitute of buildings,
            with the exception of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page408">[pg
            408]</span><a name="Pg408" id="Pg408" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            a row of thirty cells along the three walls in which the gates
            were. The outer margin of the court was paved with stone up to
            the line of the inside of the gateways (<span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
            fifty cubits, less the thickness of the outer wall); and on this
            pavement stood the cells, the dimensions of which, however, are
            not given. There were, moreover, in the four corners of the court
            rectangular enclosures forty cubits by thirty, where the Levites
            were to cook the sacrifices of the people (ch. xlvi. 21-24). The
            purpose of the cells is nowhere specified; but there is little
            doubt that they were intended for those sacrificial feasts of a
            semi-private character which had always been a prominent feature
            of the Temple worship. From the edge of the pavement to the inner
            court was a distance of a hundred cubits; but this space was free
            only on three sides, the western side being occupied by buildings
            to be afterwards described.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The inner
            court was a terrace standing probably about five feet above the
            level of the outer, and approached by flights of eight steps at
            the three gates. It was reserved for the exclusive use of the
            priests. It had three gateways in a line with those of the outer
            court, and precisely similar to them, with the single exception
            that the porches were not, as we might have expected, towards the
            inside, but at the ends next to the outer court. The free space
            of the inner court, within the line of the gateways, was a square
            of a hundred cubits, corresponding to the four middle squares of
            the diagram. Right in the middle, so that it could be seen
            through the gates, was the great altar of burnt-offering, a huge
            stone structure rising in three terraces to a height apparently
            of twelve cubits, and having a breadth and length of eighteen
            cubits at the base. That this, rather than the Temple, should be
            the centre of the sanctuary, corresponds to a consciousness in
            Israel that the altar was the one indispensable requisite for the
            performance of sacrificial worship acceptable to <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page409">[pg 409]</span><a name="Pg409" id=
            "Pg409" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Jehovah. Accordingly, when
            the first exiles returned to Jerusalem, before they were in a
            position to set about the erection of the Temple, they reared the
            altar in its place, and at once instituted the daily sacrifice
            and the stated order of the festivals. And even in Ezekiel's
            vision we shall find that the sacrificial consecration of the
            altar is considered as equivalent to the dedication of the whole
            sanctuary to the chief purpose for which it was erected. Besides
            the altar there were in the inner court certain other objects of
            special significance for the priestly and sacrificial service. By
            the side of the north and south gates were two cells or chambers
            opening towards the middle space. The purpose for which these
            cells were intended clearly points to a division of the
            priesthood (which, however, may have been temporary and not
            permanent) into two classes—one of which was entrusted with the
            service of the Temple, and the other with the service of the
            altar. The cell on the north, we are told, was for the priests
            engaged in the service of the house, and that on the south for
            those who officiated at the altar (ch. xl. 45, 46). There is
            mention also of tables on which different classes of sacrificial
            victims were slaughtered, and of a chamber in which the
            burnt-offering was washed (ch. xl. 38-43); but so obscure is the
            text of this passage that it cannot even be certainly determined
            whether these appliances were situated at the east gate or the
            north gate, or at each of the three gates.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The four small
            squares immediately adjoining the inner court on the west are
            occupied by the Temple proper and its adjuncts. The Temple itself
            stands on a solid basement six cubits above the level of the
            inner court, and is reached by a flight of ten steps. The breadth
            of the basement (north to south) is sixty cubits: this leaves a
            free space of twenty cubits on either side, which is really a
            continuation of the inner court, although it <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page410">[pg 410]</span><a name="Pg410" id=

            "he"><span style="font-style: italic">gizra</span></span>
            (<span class="tei tei-q">“separate place”</span>). In length the
            basement measures a hundred and five cubits, projecting, as we
            immediately see, five cubits into the inner court in front.<a id=
            "noteref_217" name="noteref_217" href="#note_217"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">217</span></span></a> The
            inner space of the Temple was divided, as in Solomon's Temple,
            into three compartments, communicating with each other by
            folding-doors in the middle of the partitions that separated
            them. Entering by the outer door on the east, we come first to
            the vestibule, which is twenty cubits broad (north to south) by
            twelve cubits east to west. Next to this is the hall or
            <span class="tei tei-q">“palace”</span> (<span lang="he" class=
            "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="he"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">hêkāl</span></span>), twenty cubits by
            forty. Beyond this again is the innermost shrine of the Temple,
            the Most Holy Place, where the glory of the God of Israel is to
            take the place occupied by the ark and cherubim of the first
            Temple. It is a square of twenty cubits; but Ezekiel, although
            himself a priest, is not allowed to enter this sacred space; the
            angel goes in alone, and announces the measurements to the
            prophet, who waits without in the great hall of the Temple. The
            only piece of furniture mentioned in the Temple is an altar or
            table in the hall, immediately in front of the Most Holy Place
            (ch. xli. 22). The reference is no doubt to the table on which
            the shewbread was laid out before Jehovah (cf. Exod. xxv. 23-30).
            Some details are also given of the wood-carving with which the
            interior was decorated (ch. xli. 16-20, 25), consisting
            apparently of cherubs and palm trees in alternate panels. This
            appears to be simply a reminiscence of the ornamentation of the
            old Temple, and to have no direct religious significance in the
            mind of the prophet.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page411">[pg

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Temple was
            enclosed first by a wall six cubits thick, and then on each side
            except the east by an outer wall of five cubits, separated from
            the inner by an interval of four cubits. This intervening space
            was divided into three ranges of small cells rising in three
            stories one over another. The second and third stories were
            somewhat broader than the lowest, the inner wall of the house
            being contracted so as to allow the beams to be laid upon it
            without breaking into its surface. We must further suppose that
            the inner wall rose above the cells and the outer wall, so as to
            leave a clear space for the windows of the Temple. The entire
            length of the Temple on the outside is a hundred cubits, and the
            breadth fifty cubits. This leaves room for a passage of five
            cubits broad round the edge of the elevated platform on which the
            main building stood. The two doors which gave access to the cells
            opened on this passage, and were placed in the north and south
            sides of the outer wall. There was obviously no need to continue
            the passage round the west side of the house, and this does not
            appear to be contemplated.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It will be
            seen that there still remains a square of a hundred cubits behind
            the Temple, between it and the west wall. The greater part of
            this was taken up by a structure vaguely designated as the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“building”</span> (<span lang="he" class=
            "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="he"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">binyā</span></span> or <span lang="he"
            class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="he"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">binyan</span></span>), which is commonly
            supposed to have been a sort of lumber-room, although its
            function is not indicated. Nor does it appear whether it stood on
            the level of the inner court or of the outer. But while this
            building fills the whole breadth of the square from north to
            south (a hundred cubits), the other dimension (east to west) is
            curtailed by a space of twenty cubits left free between it and
            the Temple, the <span lang="he" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "he"><span style="font-style: italic">gizra</span></span> (see p.
            <a href="#Pg410" class="tei tei-ref">410</a>) being thus
            continuous round three sides of the house.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The most
            troublesome part of the description is that <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page412">[pg 412]</span><a name="Pg412" id=
            "Pg412" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of two blocks of cells<a id=
            "noteref_218" name="noteref_218" href="#note_218"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">218</span></span></a>
            situated north and south of the Temple building (ch. xlii. 1-14).
            It seems clear that they occupied the oblong spaces between the
            <span lang="he" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "he"><span style="font-style: italic">gizra</span></span> north
            and south of the Temple and the walls of the inner court. Their
            length is said to be a hundred cubits, and their breadth fifty
            cubits. But room has to be found for a passage ten cubits broad
            and a hundred long, so that the measurements do not exhibit in
            this case Ezekiel's usual accuracy. Moreover, we are told that
            while their length facing the Temple was a hundred cubits, the
            length facing the outer court was only fifty cubits. It is
            extremely difficult to gain a clear idea of what the prophet
            meant. Smend and Davidson suppose that each block was divided
            longitudinally into two sections, and that the passage of ten
            cubits ran between them from east to west. The inner section
            would then be a hundred cubits in length and twenty in breadth.
            But the other section towards the outer court would have only
            half this length, the remaining fifty cubits along the edge of
            the inner court being protected by a wall. This is perhaps the
            best solution that has been proposed, but one can hardly help
            thinking that if Ezekiel had had such an arrangement in view he
            would have expressed himself more clearly. The one thing that is
            perfectly unambiguous is the purpose for which these cells were
            to be used. Certain sacrifices to which a high degree of sanctity
            attached were consumed by the priests, and being <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“most holy”</span> things they had to be eaten in a
            holy place. These chambers, then, standing within the sacred
            enclosure of the inner court, were assigned to the priests for
            this purpose.<a id="noteref_219" name="noteref_219" href=
            "#note_219"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">219</span></span></a> In
            them also the priests were to deposit the sacred garments
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page413">[pg 413]</span><a name=
            "Pg413" id="Pg413" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> in which they
            ministered, before leaving the inner court to mingle with the
            people.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such, then,
            are the leading features presented by Ezekiel's description of an
            ideal sanctuary. What are the chief impressions suggested to the
            mind by its perusal? The fact no doubt that surprises us most is
            that our attention is almost exclusively directed to the
            ground-plan of the buildings. It is evident that the prophet is
            indifferent to what seems to us the noblest element of
            ecclesiastical architecture, the effect of lofty spaces on the
            imagination of the worshipper. It is no part of his purpose to
            inspire devotional feeling by the aid of purely æsthetic
            impressions. <span class="tei tei-q">“The height, the span, the
            gloom, the glory”</span> of some venerable Gothic cathedral do
            not enter into his conception of a place of worship. The
            impressions he wishes to convey, although religious, are
            intellectual rather than æsthetic, and are such as could be
            expressed by the sharp outlines and mathematical precision of a
            ground-plan. Now of course the sanctuary was, to begin with, a
            place of sacrifice, and to a large extent its arrangements were
            necessarily dictated by a regard for practical convenience and
            utility. But leaving this on one side, it is obvious enough that
            the design is influenced by certain ruling principles, of which
            the most conspicuous are these three: separation, gradation, and
            symmetry. And these again symbolise three aspects of the one
            great idea of holiness, which the prophet desired to see embodied
            in the whole constitution of the Hebrew state as the guarantee of
            lasting fellowship between Jehovah and Israel.</p><span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page414">[pg 414]</span><a name="Pg414" id=
            "Pg414" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Ezekiel's
            teaching on the subject of holiness there is nothing that is
            absolutely new or peculiar to himself. That Jehovah is the one
            truly holy Being is the common doctrine of the prophets, and it
            means that He alone unites in Himself all the attributes of true
            Godhead. The Hebrew language does not admit of the formation of
            an adjective from the name for God like our word <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“divine,”</span> or an abstract noun corresponding to
            <span class="tei tei-q">“divinity.”</span> What we denote by
            these terms the Hebrews expressed by the words <span lang="he"
            class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="he"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">qādôsh</span></span> , <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“holy,”</span> and <span lang="he" class=
            "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="he"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">qōdesh</span></span>, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“holiness.”</span> All that constitutes true divinity
            is therefore summed up in the Old Testament idea of the holiness
            of God. The fundamental thought expressed by the word when
            applied to God appears to be the separation or contrast between
            the divine and the human—that in God which inspires awe and
            reverence on the part of man, and forbids approach to Him save
            under restrictions which flow from the nature of the Deity. In
            the light of the New Testament revelation we see that the only
            barrier to communion with God is sin; and hence to us holiness,
            both in God and man, is a purely ethical idea denoting moral
            purity and perfectness. But under the Old Testament access to God
            was hindered not only by sin, but also by natural disabilities to
            which no moral guilt attaches. The idea of holiness is therefore
            partly ethical and partly ceremonial, physical uncleanness being
            as really a violation of the divine holiness, as offences against
            the moral law. The consequences of this view appear nowhere more
            clearly than in the legislation of Ezekiel. His mind was
            penetrated with the prophetic idea of the unique divinity or
            holiness of Jehovah, and no one can doubt that the moral
            attributes of God occupied the supreme place in his conception of
            what true Godhead is. But along with this he has a profound sense
            of what the nature of Jehovah demands in the way of ceremonial
            purity. The divine holiness, in fact, <span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page415">[pg 415]</span><a name="Pg415" id="Pg415" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> contains a physical as well as an ethical
            element; and to guard against the intrusion of anything unclean
            into the sphere of Jehovah's worship is the chief design of the
            elaborate system of ritual laws laid down in the closing chapters
            of Ezekiel. Ultimately no doubt the whole system served a moral
            purpose by furnishing a safeguard against the introduction of
            heathen practices into the worship of Israel. But its immediate
            effect was to give prominence to that aspect of the idea of
            holiness which seems to us of least value, although it could not
            be dispensed with so long as the worship of God took the form of
            material offerings at a local sanctuary.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now in
            reducing this idea to practice it is obvious that everything
            depends on the strict enforcement of the principle of separation
            that lies at the root of the Hebrew conception of holiness. The
            thought that underlies Ezekiel's legislation is that the holiness
            of Jehovah is communicated in different degrees to everything
            connected with His worship, and in the first instance to the
            Temple, which is sanctified by His presence. The sanctity of the
            place is of course not fully intelligible apart from the
            ceremonial rules which regulate the conduct of those who are
            permitted to enter it. Throughout the ancient world we find
            evidence of the existence of sacred enclosures which could only
            be entered by those who fulfilled certain conditions of physical
            purity. The conditions might be extremely simple, as when Moses
            was commanded to take his shoes off his feet as he stood within
            the holy ground on Mount Sinai. But obviously the first essential
            of a permanently sacred place was that it should be definitely
            marked off from common ground, as the sphere within which
            superior requirements of holiness became binding. A holy place is
            necessarily a place <span class="tei tei-q">“cut off,”</span>
            separated from ordinary use and guarded from intrusion by
            supernatural sanctions. The idea of the sanctuary as a separate
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page416">[pg 416]</span><a name=
            "Pg416" id="Pg416" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> place was
            therefore perfectly familiar to the Israelites long before the
            time of Ezekiel, and had been exhibited in a lax and imperfect
            way in the construction of the first Temple. But what Ezekiel did
            was to carry out the idea with a thoroughness never before
            attempted, and in such a way as to make the whole arrangements of
            the sanctuary an impressive object lesson on the holiness of
            Jehovah.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">How important
            this notion of separateness was to Ezekiel's conception of the
            sanctuary is best seen from the emphatic condemnation of the
            arrangement of the old Temple pronounced by Jehovah Himself on
            His entrance into the house: <span class="tei tei-q">“Son of man,
            [hast thou seen]<a id="noteref_220" name="noteref_220" href=
            "#note_220"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">220</span></span></a> the
            place of My throne, and the place of the soles of My feet, where
            I shall dwell in the midst of the children of Israel for ever? No
            longer shall the house of Israel defile My holy name, they and
            their kings, by their whoredom [idolatry], and by the corpses of
            their kings in their death; by placing their threshold alongside
            of My threshold, and their post beside My post, with only the
            wall between Me and them, and defiling My holy name by their
            abominations which they committed; so that I consumed them in My
            anger. But now they must remove their whoredom and the corpses of
            their kings from Me, and I will dwell amongst them for
            ever”</span> (ch. xliii. 7-9). There is here a clear allusion to
            defects in the structure of the Temple which were inconsistent
            with a due recognition of the necessary separation between the
            holy and the profane (ch. xlii. 20). It appears that the first
            Temple had only one court, corresponding to the inner court of
            Ezekiel's vision. What answered to the outer court was simply an
            enclosure surrounding, not only the Temple, but also the royal
            palace and the other buildings <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page417">[pg 417]</span><a name="Pg417" id="Pg417" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> of state. Immediately adjoining the Temple
            area on the south was the court in which the palace stood, so
            that the only division between the dwelling-place of Jehovah and
            the residence of the kings of Judah was the single wall
            separating the two courts. This of itself was derogatory to the
            sanctity of the Temple, according to the enhanced idea of
            holiness which it was Ezekiel's mission to enforce. But the
            prophet touches on a still more flagrant transgression of the law
            of holiness when he speaks of the dead bodies of the kings as
            being interred in the neighbourhood of the Temple. Contact with a
            dead body produced under all circumstances the highest degree of
            ceremonial uncleanness, and nothing could have been more
            abhorrent to Ezekiel's priestly sense of propriety than the close
            proximity of dead men's bones to the house in which Jehovah was
            to dwell. In order to guard against the recurrence of these
            abuses in the future it was necessary that all secular buildings
            should be removed to a safe distance from the Temple precincts.
            The <span class="tei tei-q">“law of the house”</span> is that
            <span class="tei tei-q">“upon the top of the mountain it shall
            stand, and all its precincts round about shall be most
            holy”</span> (ch. xliii. 12). And it is characteristic of Ezekiel
            that the separation is effected, not by changing the situation of
            the Temple, but by transporting the city bodily to the southward;
            so that the new sanctuary stood on the site of the old, but
            isolated from the contact of that in human life which was common
            and unclean.<a id="noteref_221" name="noteref_221" href=
            "#note_221"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">221</span></span></a></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The effect of
            this teaching, however, is immensely enhanced by the principle of
            gradation, which is the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page418">[pg
            418]</span><a name="Pg418" id="Pg418" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            second feature exhibited in Ezekiel's description of the
            sanctuary. Holiness, as a predicate of persons or things, is
            after all a relative idea. That which is <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“most holy”</span> in relation to the profane
            every-day life of men may be less holy in comparison with
            something still more closely associated with the presence of God.
            Thus the whole land of Israel was holy in contrast with the world
            lying outside. But it was impossible to maintain the whole land
            in a state of ceremonial purity corresponding to the sanctity of
            Jehovah. The full compass of the idea could only be illustrated
            by a carefully graded series of sacred spaces, each of which
            entailed provisions of sanctity peculiar to itself. First of all
            an <span class="tei tei-q">“oblation”</span> is set apart in the
            middle of the tribes; and of this the central portion is assigned
            for the residence of the priestly families. In the midst of this,
            again, stands the sanctuary with its wall and precinct, dividing
            the holy from the profane (ch. xlii. 20). Within the wall are the
            two courts, of which the outer could only be trodden by
            circumcised Israelites and the inner only by the priests. Behind
            the inner court stands the Temple house, cut off from the
            adjoining buildings by a <span class="tei tei-q">“separate
            place,”</span> and elevated on a platform, which still further
            guards its sanctity from profane contact. And finally the
            interior of the house is divided into three compartments,
            increasing in holiness in the order of entrance—first the porch,
            then the main hall, and then the Most Holy Place, where Jehovah
            Himself dwells. It is impossible to mistake the meaning of all
            this. The practical object is to secure the presence <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page419">[pg 419]</span><a name="Pg419" id=
            "Pg419" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of Jehovah against the
            possibility of contact with those sources of impurity which are
            inseparably bound up with the incidents of man's natural
            existence on earth.<a id="noteref_222" name="noteref_222" href=
            "#note_222"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before we pass
            on let us return for a moment to the primary notion of separation
            in space as an emblem of the Old Testament conception of
            holiness. What is the permanent religious truth underlying this
            representation? We may find it in the idea conveyed by the
            familiar phrase <span class="tei tei-q">“draw near to
            God.”</span> What we have just seen reminds us that there was a
            stage in the history of religion when these words could be used
            in the most literal sense of every act of complete worship. The
            worshipper actually came to the place where God was; it was
            impossible to realise His presence in any other way. To us the
            expression has only a metaphorical value; yet the metaphor is one
            that we cannot dispense with, for it covers a fact of spiritual
            experience. It may be true that with God there is no far or near,
            that He is omnipresent, that His eyes are in every place
            beholding the evil and the good. But what does that mean? Not
            surely that all men everywhere and at all times are equally under
            the influence of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page420">[pg
            420]</span><a name="Pg420" id="Pg420" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            the divine Spirit? No; but only that God <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">may</span></em>
            be found in any place by the soul that is open to receive His
            grace and truth, that place has nothing to do with the conditions
            of true fellowship with Him. Translated into terms of the
            spiritual life, drawing near to God denotes the act of faith or
            prayer or consecration, through which we seek the manifestation
            of His love in our experience. Religion knows nothing of
            <span class="tei tei-q">“action at a distance”</span>; God is
            near in every place to the soul that knows Him, and distant in
            every place from the heart that loves darkness rather than
            light.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now when the
            idea of access to God is thus spiritualised the conception of
            holiness is necessarily transformed, but it is not superseded. At
            every stage of revelation holiness is that <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“without which no man shall see the
            Lord.”</span><a id="noteref_223" name="noteref_223" href=
            "#note_223"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">223</span></span></a> In
            other words, it expresses the conditions that regulate all true
            fellowship with God. So long as worship was confined to an
            earthly sanctuary these conditions were so to speak materialised.
            They resolved themselves into a series of <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“carnal ordinances”</span>—gifts and sacrifices,
            meats, drinks, and divers washings—that could never make the
            worshipper perfect as touching the conscience. These things were
            <span class="tei tei-q">“imposed until a time of
            reformation,”</span> the <span class="tei tei-q">“Holy Ghost this
            signifying, that the way into the holy place had not been made
            manifest while as the first tabernacle was yet
            standing.”</span><a id="noteref_224" name="noteref_224" href=
            "#note_224"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">224</span></span></a> And
            yet when we consider what it was that gave such vitality to that
            persistent sense of distance from God, of His unapproachableness,
            of danger in contact with Him, what it was that inspired such
            constant attention to ceremonial purity in all ancient religions,
            we cannot but see that it was the obscure workings of the
            conscience, the haunting sense of moral defect cleaving to a
            man's common life and all his common <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page421">[pg 421]</span><a name="Pg421" id="Pg421" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> actions. In heathenism this feeling took an
            entirely wrong direction; in Israel it was gradually liberated
            from its material associations and stood forth as an ethical
            fact. And when at last Christ came to reveal God as He is, He
            taught men to call nothing common or unclean. But He taught them
            at the same time that true holiness can only be attained through
            His atoning sacrifice, and by the indwelling of that Spirit which
            is the source of moral purity and perfection in all His people.
            These are the abiding conditions of fellowship with the Father of
            our spirits; and under the influence of these great Christian
            facts it is our duty to perfect holiness in the fear of God.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No sooner has
            the prophet completed his tour of inspection of the sacred
            buildings than he is conducted to the eastern gate to witness the
            theophany by which the Temple is consecrated to the service of
            the true God. <span class="tei tei-q">“He (the angel) led me to
            the gate that looks eastward, and, lo, the glory of the God of
            Israel came from the east; its sound was as the sound of many
            waters, and the earth shone with its glory. The appearance which
            I saw was like that which I had seen when He came to destroy the
            city, and like the appearance which I saw by the river Kebar, and
            I fell on my face. And the glory of Jehovah entered the house by
            the gate that looks towards the east. The Spirit caught me up,
            and brought me to the inner court; and, behold, the glory of
            Jehovah filled the house. Then I heard a voice from the house
            speaking to me—the man was standing beside me—and saying, Son of
            man, hast thou seen the place of My throne, and the place of the
            soles of My feet, where I shall dwell in the midst of the
            children of Israel for ever?”</span> (ch. xliii.

            422]</span><a name="Pg422" id="Pg422" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This great
            scene, so simply described, is really the culmination of
            Ezekiel's prophecy. Its spiritual meaning is suggested by the
            prophet himself when he recalls the terrible act of judgment
            which he had seen in vision on that very spot some twenty years
            before (chs. ix.-xi.). The two episodes stand in clear and
            conscious parallelism with each other. They represent in dramatic
            form the sum of Ezekiel's teaching in the two periods into which
            his ministry was divided. On the former occasion he had witnessed
            the exit of Jehovah from a Temple polluted by heathen
            abominations and profaned by the presence of men who had disowned
            the knowledge of the Holy One of Israel. The prophet had read in
            this the death sentence of the old Hebrew state, and the truth of
            his vision had been established in the tale of horror and
            disaster which the subsequent years had unfolded. Now he has been
            privileged to see the return of Jehovah to a new Temple,
            corresponding in all respects to the requirements of His
            holiness; and he recognises it as the pledge of restoration and
            peace and all the blessings of the Messianic age. The future
            worshippers are still in exile bearing the chastisement of their
            former iniquities; but <span class="tei tei-q">“the Lord is in
            His holy Temple,”</span> and the dispersed of Israel shall yet be
            gathered home to enter His courts with praise and
            thanksgiving.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To us this
            part of the vision symbolises, under forms derived from the Old
            Testament economy, the central truth of the Christian
            dispensation. We do no injustice to the historic import of
            Ezekiel's mission when we say that the dwelling of Jehovah in the
            midst of His people is an emblem of reconciliation between God
            and man, and that his elaborate system of ritual observances
            points towards the sanctification of human life in all its
            relations through spiritual communion with the Father revealed in
            our Lord Jesus Christ. Christian interpreters <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page423">[pg 423]</span><a name="Pg423" id=
            "Pg423" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> have differed widely as to
            the manner in which the vision is to be realised in the history
            of the Church; but on one point at least they are agreed, that
            through the veil of legal institutions the prophet saw the day of
            Christ. And although Ezekiel himself does not distinguish between
            the symbol and the reality, it is nevertheless possible for us to
            see, in the essential ideas of his vision, a prophecy of that
            eternal union between God and man which is brought to pass by the
            work of Christ.</p>

          <span style="font-size: 144%">Chapter XXVII. The Priesthood.
          Chapter xliv.</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the last
          chapter we saw how the principle of holiness through separation was
          exhibited in the plan of a new Temple, round which the Theocracy of
          the future was to be constituted. We have now to consider the
          application of the same principle to the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">personnel</span></em> of the Sanctuary, the
          priests and others who are to officiate within its courts. The
          connection between the two is obvious. As has been already
          remarked, the sanctity of the Temple is not intelligible apart from
          the ceremonial purity required of the persons who are permitted to
          enter it. The degrees of holiness pertaining to its different areas
          imply an ascending scale of restrictions on access to the more
          sacred parts. We may expect to find that in the observance of these
          conditions the usage of the first Temple left much to be desired
          from the point of view represented by Ezekiel's ideal. Where the
          very construction of the sanctuary involved so many departures from
          the strict idea of holiness it was inevitable that a corresponding
          laxity should prevail in the discharge of sacred functions. Temple
          and priesthood in fact are so related that a reform of the one
          implies of necessity a reform of the other. It is therefore not in
          itself surprising that Ezekiel's legislation should include a
          scheme for the reorganisation of <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page425">[pg 425]</span><a name="Pg425" id="Pg425" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> the Temple priesthood. But these general
          considerations hardly prepare us for the sweeping and drastic
          changes contemplated in the forty-fourth chapter of the book. It
          requires an effort of imagination to realise the situation with
          which the prophet has to deal. The abuses for which he seeks a
          remedy and the measures which he adopts to counteract them are
          alike contrary to preconceived notions of the order of worship in
          an Israelite sanctuary. Yet there is no part of the prophet's
          programme which shows the character of the earnest practical
          reformer more clearly than this. If we might regard Ezekiel as a
          mere legislator we should say that the boldest task to which he set
          his hand was a reformation of the Temple ministry, involving the
          degradation of an influential class from the priestly status and
          privileges to which they aspired.</p>

          <div class="tei tei-div" style=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first and
            most noteworthy feature of the new scheme is the distinction
            between priests and Levites. The passage in which this
            instruction is given is so important that it may be quoted here
            at length. It is an oracle communicated to the prophet in a
            peculiarly impressive manner. He has been brought into the inner
            court in front of the Temple, and there, in full view of the
            glory of God, he falls on his face, when Jehovah speaks to him as
            follows:—</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Son of man, give heed and see with thine eyes and
            hear with thine ears all that I speak to thee concerning all the
            ordinances and all the laws of Jehovah's house. Mark well the
            [rule of] entrance into the house, and all the outgoings in the
            sanctuary. And say to the house of rebellion, the house of
            Israel: Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, It is high time to desist
            from all your abominations, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page426">[pg 426]</span><a name="Pg426" id="Pg426" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> O house of Israel, in that ye bring in
            aliens uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh to be in
            My sanctuary, profaning it, while ye offer My bread, the fat and
            the blood; thus ye have broken My covenant, in addition to all
            your [other] abominations; and ye have not kept the charge of My
            holy things, but have appointed them as keepers of My charge in
            My sanctuary. Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah, No alien
            uncircumcised in heart and flesh shall enter into My sanctuary,
            of all the foreigners who are amongst the Israelites. But the
            Levites who departed from Me when Israel went astray from Me
            after their idols, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">they</span></em> shall bear their guilt, and
            shall minister in My sanctuary in charge at the gates of the
            house and as ministers of the house; they shall slay the burnt
            offering and the sacrifice for the people, and stand before them
            to minister to them. Because they ministered to them before their
            idols, and were to the house of Israel an occasion of guilt,
            therefore I lift My hand against them, saith the Lord Jehovah,
            and they shall bear their guilt, and shall not draw near to Me to
            act as priests to Me or to touch any of My holy things, the most
            holy things, but shall bear their shame and the abominations
            which they have committed. I will make them keepers of the charge
            of the house, for all its servile work and all that has to be
            done in it. But the priest-Levites, the sons of Zadok, who kept
            the charge of My sanctuary when the Israelites strayed from
            Me—they shall draw near to Me to minister to Me, and shall stand
            before Me to present to Me the fat and the blood, saith the Lord
            Jehovah. They shall enter into My sanctuary, and they shall draw
            near to My table to minister to Me, and shall keep My
            charge”</span> (xliv. 5-16).</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now the first
            thing to be noticed here is that the new law of the priesthood is
            aimed directly against a particular abuse in the practice of the
            first Temple. It appears that <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page427">[pg 427]</span><a name="Pg427" id="Pg427" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> down to the time of the Exile uncircumcised
            aliens were not only admitted to the Temple, but were entrusted
            with certain important functions in maintaining order in the
            sanctuary (ver. 8). It is not expressly stated that they took any
            part in the performance of the worship, although this is
            suggested by the fact that the Levites who are installed in their
            place had to slay the sacrifices for the people and render other
            necessary services to the worshippers (ver. 11). In any case the
            mere presence of foreigners while sacrifice was being offered
            (ver. 7) was a profanation of the sanctity of the Temple which
            was intolerable to a strict conception of Jehovah's holiness. It
            is therefore of some consequence to discover who these aliens
            were, and how they came to be engaged in the Temple.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For a partial
            answer to this question, we may turn first to the memorable scene
            of the coronation of the young king Joash as described in the
            eleventh chapter of the second book of Kings (<span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c.</span></span>
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> 837). The moving
            spirit in that transaction was the chief priest Jehoiada, a man
            who was honourably distinguished by his zeal for the purity of
            the national religion. But although the priest's motives were
            pure he could only accomplish his object by a palace revolution,
            carried out with the assistance of the captains of the royal
            bodyguard. Now from the time of David the royal guard had
            contained a corps of foreign mercenaries recruited from the
            Philistine country; and on the occasion with which we are dealing
            we find mention of a body of Carians, showing that the custom was
            kept up in the end of the ninth century. During the coronation
            ceremony these guards were drawn up in the most sacred part of
            the inner court, the space between the Temple and the altar, with
            the new king in their midst (ver. 11). Moreover we learn
            incidentally that keeping watch in the Temple was part of the
            regular duty of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page428">[pg
            428]</span><a name="Pg428" id="Pg428" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            king's bodyguard, just as much as the custody of the palace (vv.
            5-7). In order to understand the full significance of this
            arrangement, it must be borne in mind that the Temple was in the
            first instance the royal sanctuary, maintained at the king's
            expense and subject to his authority. Hence the duty of keeping
            order in the Temple courts naturally devolved on the troops that
            attended the king's person and acted as the palace guard. So at
            an earlier period of the history we read that as often as the
            king went into the house of Jehovah, he was accompanied by the
            guard that kept the door of the king's house (1 Kings xiv. 27,
            28).</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here, then, we
            have historical evidence of the admission to the sanctuary of a
            class of foreigners answering in all respects to the
            uncircumcised aliens of Ezekiel's legislation. That the practice
            of enlisting foreign mercenaries for the guard continued till the
            reign of Josiah seems to be indicated by an allusion in the book
            of Zephaniah, where the prophet denounces a body of men in the
            service of the king who observed the Philistine custom of
            <span class="tei tei-q">“leaping over the threshold”</span>
            (Zeph. i. 9: cf. 1 Sam. v. 5). We have only to suppose that this
            usage, along with the subordination of the Temple to the royal
            authority, persisted to the close of the monarchy, in order to
            explain fully the abuse which excited the indignation of our
            prophet. It is possible no doubt that he had in view other
            uncircumcised persons as well, such as the Gibeonites (Josh. ix.
            27), who were employed in the menial service of the sanctuary.
            But we have seen enough to show at all events that pre-exilic
            usage tolerated a freedom of access to the sanctuary and a
            looseness of administration within it which would have been
            sacrilegious under the law of the second Temple. It need not be
            supposed that Ezekiel was the only one who felt this state of
            things to be a scandal and an injury to religion. We may believe
            that in this respect he only <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page429">[pg 429]</span><a name="Pg429" id="Pg429" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> expressed the higher conscience of his
            order. Amongst the more devout circles of the Temple priesthood
            there was probably a growing conviction similar to that which
            animated the early Tractarian party in the Church of England, a
            conviction that the whole ecclesiastical system with which their
            spiritual interests were bound up fell short of the ideal of
            sanctity essential to it as a divine institution. But no scheme
            of reform had any chance of success so long as the palace of the
            kings stood hard by the Temple, with only a wall between them.
            The opportunity for reconstruction came with the Exile, and one
            of the leading principles of the reformed Temple is that here
            enunciated by Ezekiel, that no <span class="tei tei-q">“alien
            uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh”</span> shall
            henceforth enter the sanctuary.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In order to
            prevent a recurrence of these abuses Ezekiel ordains that for the
            future the functions of the Temple guard and other menial offices
            shall be discharged by the Levites who had hitherto acted as
            priests of the idolatrous shrines throughout the kingdom (vv.
            11-14). This singular enactment becomes at once intelligible when
            we understand the peculiar circumstances brought about by the
            enforcement of the Deuteronomic Law in the reformation of the
            year 621. Let us once more recall the fact that the chief object
            of that reformation was to do away with all the provincial
            sanctuaries and to concentrate the worship of the nation in the
            Temple at Jerusalem. It is obvious that by this measure the
            priests of the local sanctuaries were deprived of their means of
            livelihood. The rule that they who serve the altar shall live by
            the altar applied equally to the priests of the high places and
            to those in the Temple at Jerusalem. All the priests indeed
            throughout the country were members of a landless caste or tribe;
            the Levites had no portion or inheritance like the other tribes,
            but subsisted <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page430">[pg
            430]</span><a name="Pg430" id="Pg430" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            on the offerings of the worshippers at the various shrines where
            they ministered. Now the law of Deuteronomy recognises the
            principle of compensation for the vested interests that were thus
            abolished. Two alternatives were offered to the Levites of the
            high places: they might either remain in the villages or
            townships where they were known, or they might proceed to the
            central sanctuary and obtain admission to the ranks of the
            priesthood there. In the former case, the Lawgiver commends them
            earnestly, along with other destitute members of the community,
            to the charity of their well-to-do fellow-townsmen and
            neighbours. If, on the other hand, they elected to try their
            fortunes in the Temple at Jerusalem, he secures their full
            priestly status and equal rights with their brethren who
            regularly officiated there. On this point the legislation is
            quite explicit. Any Levite from any district of Israel who came
            of his own free will to the place which Jehovah had chosen might
            minister in the name of Jehovah his God, as all his brethren the
            Levites did who stood there before Jehovah, and have like
            portions to eat (Deut. xviii. 6-8). In this matter, however, the
            humane intention of the law was partly frustrated by the
            exclusiveness of the priests who were already in possession of
            the sacred offices in the Temple. The Levites who were brought up
            from the provinces to Jerusalem were allowed their proper share
            of the priestly dues, but were not permitted to officiate at the
            altar.<a id="noteref_225" name="noteref_225" href=
            "#note_225"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">225</span></span></a> It
            is not probable that a large number of the provincial Levites
            availed themselves of this grudging provision for their
            maintenance. In the idolatrous reaction which <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page431">[pg 431]</span><a name="Pg431" id=
            "Pg431" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> set in after the death of
            Josiah the worship of the high places was revived, and the great
            body of the Levites would naturally be favourable to the
            re-establishment of the old order of things with which their
            professional interests were identified. Still, there would be a
            certain number who for conscientious motives attached themselves
            to the movement for a purer and stricter conception of the
            worship of Jehovah, and were willing to submit to the irksome
            conditions which this movement imposed on them. They might hope
            for a time when the generous provisions of the Deuteronomic Code
            would be applied to them; but their position in the meantime was
            both precarious and humiliating. They had to bear the doom
            pronounced long ago on the sinful house of Eli: <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Every one that is left in thine house shall come and
            bow down to him (the high priest of the line of Zadok) for a
            piece of silver and a loaf of bread, and shall say, Thrust me, I
            pray thee, into one of the priests' offices, that I may eat a
            morsel of bread.”</span><a id="noteref_226" name="noteref_226"
            href="#note_226"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">226</span></span></a></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We see thus
            that Ezekiel's legislation on the subject of the Levites starts
            from a state of things created by Josiah's reformation, and, let
            us remember, a state of things with which the prophet was
            familiar in his earlier days when he was himself a priest in the
            Temple. On the whole he justifies the exclusive attitude of the
            Temple priesthood towards the new-comers, and carries forward the
            application of the idea of sanctity from the point where it had
            been left by the law of Deuteronomy. That law recognises no
            sacerdotal distinctions within the ranks of the priesthood. Its
            regular designation of the priests of the Temple is <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“the priests, the Levites”</span>; that of the
            provincial priests is simply <span class="tei tei-q">“the
            Levites.”</span> All priests are brethren, all belong to the same
            tribe of Levi; and it <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page432">[pg
            432]</span><a name="Pg432" id="Pg432" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            is assumed, as we have seen, that any Levite, whatever his
            antecedents, is qualified for the full privileges of the
            priesthood in the central sanctuary if he choose to claim them.
            But we have also seen that the distinction emerged as a
            consequence of the enforcement of the fundamental law of the
            single sanctuary. There came to be a class of Levites in the
            Temple whose position was at first indeterminate. They themselves
            claimed the full standing of the priesthood, and they could
            appeal in support of their claim to the authority of the
            Deuteronomic legislation. But the claim was never conceded in
            practice, the influence of the legitimate Temple priests being
            strong enough to exclude them from the supreme privilege of
            ministering at the altar. This state of things could not
            continue. Either the disparity of the two orders must be effaced
            by the admission of the Levites to a footing of equality with the
            other priests, or else it must be emphasised and based on some
            higher principle than the jealousy of a close corporation for its
            traditional rights. Now such a principle is supplied by the
            section of Ezekiel's vision with which we are dealing. The
            permanent exclusion of the Levites from the priesthood is founded
            on the unassailable moral ground that they had forfeited their
            rights by their unfaithfulness to the fundamental truths of the
            national religion. They had been a <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“stumbling-block of iniquity”</span> to the house of
            Israel through their disloyalty to Jehovah's cause during the
            long period of national apostasy, when they lent themselves to
            the popular inclination towards impure and idolatrous worship.
            For this great betrayal of their trust they must bear the guilt
            and shame in their degradation to the lowest offices in the
            service of the new sanctuary. They are to fill the place formerly
            occupied by uncircumcised foreigners, as keepers of the gates and
            servants of the house and the worshipping congregation; but they
            may not draw near to Jehovah in the exercise <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page433">[pg 433]</span><a name="Pg433" id=
            "Pg433" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of priestly prerogatives, nor
            put their hands to the most holy things. The priesthood of the
            new Temple is finally vested in the <span class="tei tei-q">“sons
            of Zadok”</span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the body of Levitical
            priests who had ministered in the Temple since its foundation by
            Solomon. Whatever the faults of these Zadokites had been—and
            Ezekiel certainly does not judge them leniently<a id=
            "noteref_227" name="noteref_227" href="#note_227"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">227</span></span></a>—they
            had at least steadfastly maintained the ideal of a central
            sanctuary, and in comparison with the rural clergy they were
            doubtless a purer and better-disciplined body. The judgment is
            only a relative one, as all class judgments necessarily are.
            There must have been individual Zadokites worse than an ordinary
            Levite from the country, as well as individual Levites who were
            superior to the average Temple priest. But if it was necessary
            that in the future the interests of religion should be mainly
            confided to a priesthood, there could be no question that as a
            class the old priestly aristocracy of the central sanctuary were
            those best qualified for spiritual leadership.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Ezekiel's
            vision we thus seem to find the beginning of a statutory and
            official distinction between priests and Levites. This fact forms
            one of the arguments chiefly relied on by those who hold that the
            book of Ezekiel precedes the introduction of the Priestly Code of
            the Pentateuch. Two things, indeed, appear to be clearly
            established. In the first place the tendency and significance of
            Ezekiel's legislation is adequately explained by the historical
            situation that existed in the generation immediately preceding
            the Exile. In the second place the Mosaic books, apart from
            Deuteronomy, had no influence on the scheme propounded in the
            vision. It is felt that these results are difficult to reconcile
            with the view that the middle books of the Pentateuch were known
            to the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page434">[pg
            434]</span><a name="Pg434" id="Pg434" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            prophet as part of a divinely ordained constitution for the
            Israelite theocracy. We should have expected in that case that
            the prophet would simply have fallen back on the provisions of
            the earlier legislation, where the division between priests and
            Levites is formulated with perfect clearness and precision. Or,
            looking at the matter from the divine point of view, we should
            have expected that the revelation given to Ezekiel would endorse
            the principles of the revelation that had already been given. It
            is equally hard to suppose that any existing law should have been
            unknown to Ezekiel, or to suggest a reason for his ignoring it if
            it was known. The facts that have come before us seem thus, so
            far as they go, to be in favour of the theory that Ezekiel stands
            midway between Deuteronomy and the Priestly Code, and that the
            final codification and promulgation of the latter took place
            after his time.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is nearer
            our purpose, however, to note the probable effect of these
            regulations on the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">personnel</span></em> of the second Temple.
            In the book of Ezra we are told that in the first colony of
            returning exiles there were four thousand two hundred and
            eighty-nine priests and only seventy-four Levites.<a id=
            "noteref_228" name="noteref_228" href="#note_228"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">228</span></span></a> One
            man in every ten was a priest, and the total number was probably
            in excess of the requirements of a fully equipped Temple. The
            number of Levites, on the other hand, would have been quite
            insufficient for the duties required of them under the new
            arrangements, had there not been a contingent of nearly four
            hundred of the old Temple servants to supply their lack of
            service.<a id="noteref_229" name="noteref_229" href=
            "#note_229"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">229</span></span></a>
            Again, when Ezra came up from Babylon in the year 458, we find
            that not a single Levite volunteered to accompany him. It was
            only after some negotiations that about forty Levites were
            induced to go up with him to Jerusalem; and again they were far
            outnumbered by the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page435">[pg
            435]</span><a name="Pg435" id="Pg435" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

            These figures cannot possibly represent the proportionate
            strength of the tribe of Levi under the old monarchy. They
            indicate unmistakably that there was a great reluctance on the
            part of the Levites to share the perils and glory of the founding
            of the new Jerusalem. Is it not probable that the new conditions
            laid down by Ezekiel's legislation were the cause of this
            reluctance? That, in short, the prospect of being servants in a
            Temple where they had once claimed to be priests was not
            sufficiently attractive to the majority to lead them to break up
            their comfortable homes in exile, and take their proper place in
            the ranks of those who were forming the new community of Israel?
            And ought we not to spare a moment's admiration even at this
            distance of time for the public-spirited few who in
            self-sacrificing devotion to the cause of God willingly accepted
            a position which was scorned by the great mass of their
            tribesmen? If this was their spirit, they had their reward.
            Although the position of a Levite was at first a symbol of
            inferiority and degradation, it ultimately became one of very
            great honour. When the Temple service was fully organised, the
            Levites were a large and important order, second in dignity in
            the community only to the priests. Their ranks were swelled by
            the incorporation of the Temple musicians, as well as other
            functionaries; and thus the Levites are for ever associated in
            our minds with the magnificent service of praise which was the
            chief glory of the second Temple.</p>

            sanctity of the priests is denoted, first of all, by the
            obligation to wear special linen garments when they enter the
            inner court, which is the sphere of their peculiar ministrations.
            Vestries were provided, as we have seen from the description of

            garments were to be put on and off as the priests passed to and
            from the discharge of their sacred duties. The general idea
            underlying this regulation is too obvious to require explanation.
            It is but an application of the fundamental principle that
            approach to the Deity, or entrance into a place sanctified by His
            presence, demands a condition of ceremonial purity which cannot
            be maintained and must not be imitated by persons of a lower
            degree of religious privilege. A strange but very suggestive
            extension of the principle is found in the injunction to put off
            the garments before going into the outer court, lest the ordinary
            worshipper should be sanctified by chance contact with them. That
            both holiness and uncleanness are propagated by contagion is of
            the very essence of the ancient idea of sanctity; but the
            remarkable thing is that in some circumstances communicated
            holiness is as much to be dreaded as communicated uncleanness. It
            is not said what would be the fate of an Israelite who should by
            chance touch the sacred vestments, but evidently he must be
            disqualified for participation in worship until he had purged
            himself of his illegitimate sanctity.<a id="noteref_231" name=

            mark of the peculiar sanctity of their caste. The rules as to

            been thought to be directed against heathen customs arising out
            of the worship of the dead. In marriage the priest may only take
            a virgin of the house of Israel or the widow of a priest. And
            only in the case of his nearest relatives—parent, child, brother,
            and unmarried sister—may he defile himself by rendering the last
            offices to the departed, and even these exceptions involve
            exclusion from the sacred office for seven days.<a id=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The relations
            of these requirements to the corresponding parts of the Levitical
            law are somewhat complicated. The great point of difference is
            that Ezekiel knows nothing of the unique privileges and sanctity
            of the high priest. It might seem at first sight as if this
            implied a deliberate departure from the known usage of the first
            Temple. It is certain that there were high priests under the
            monarchy, and indeed we can discover the rudiments of a hierarchy
            in a distribution of authority between the high priest, second
            priest, keepers of the threshold, and chief officers of the
            house.<a id="noteref_234" name="noteref_234" href=

            the silence of Ezekiel does not necessarily mean that he
            contemplated any innovation on the established order of things.
            The historical books afford no ground for supposing that the high
            priest in the old Temple had a religious standing distinguished
            from that of his colleagues. He was <span lang="la" class=
            "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=

            pares</span></span>, the president of the priestly college and
            the supreme authority in the internal administration of the
            Temple affairs, but probably nothing more. Such an office was
            almost necessary in the interest of order and authority, and
            there is nothing in Ezekiel's regulations inconsistent with its
            continuance.<a id="noteref_235" name="noteref_235" href=
            "#note_235"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">235</span></span></a> On
            the other hand it must be admitted that his silence would be
            strange if he had in view the position assigned to the high
            priest under the law. For there the high priest is as far
            elevated above his colleagues as these are above the Levites. He
            is the concentration of all that is holy in Israel, and the sole
            mediator of the nearest approach to God which the symbolism of
            Temple worship permitted. He is bound by the strictest conditions
            of ceremonial sanctity, and any transgression on his part has to
            be atoned for by a rite similar to that required for a
            transgression of the whole congregation.<a id="noteref_236" name=
            "noteref_236" href="#note_236"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">236</span></span></a> The
            omission of this striking figure from the pages of Ezekiel makes
            a comparison between his enactments concerning the priesthood and
            those of the law difficult and in some degree uncertain.
            Nevertheless there are points both of likeness and contrast which
            cannot escape observation. Thus the laws of this chapter on
            defilement by a dead body are identical with those enjoined in
            Lev. xxi. 1-3 (the <span class="tei tei-q">“Law of
            Holiness”</span>) for ordinary priests; while the high priest is
            there forbidden to touch any dead body whatsoever. On the other
            hand Ezekiel's regulations as to priestly marriages seem as it
            were to strike an average between the restrictions imposed in the
            law on ordinary priests and those binding on the high priest. The
            former may marry any woman that is not violated or a harlot or a
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page439">[pg 439]</span><a name=
            "Pg439" id="Pg439" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> divorced wife; but
            the high priest is forbidden to marry any one but a virgin of his
            own people. Again, the priestly garments, according to Exod.
            xxviii. 39-42, xxxix. 27, are made partly of linen and partly of
            byssus (? cotton), which certainly looks like a refinement on the
            simpler attire prescribed by Ezekiel. But it is impossible to
            pursue this subject further here.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">2. The duties
            of the priests towards the people are few, but exceedingly
            important. In the first place they have to instruct the people in
            the distinctions between the holy and the profane and between the
            clean and the unclean. It will not be supposed that this
            instruction took the form of set lectures or homilies on the
            principles of ceremonial religion. The verb translated
            <span class="tei tei-q">“teach”</span> in ver. 23 means to give
            an authoritative decision in a special case; and this had always
            been the form of priestly instruction in Israel. The subject of
            the teaching was of the utmost importance for a community whose
            whole life was regulated by the idea of holiness in the
            ceremonial sense. To preserve the land in a state of purity
            befitting the dwelling-place of Jehovah required the most
            scrupulous care on the part of all its inhabitants; and in
            practice difficult questions would constantly occur which could
            only be settled by an appeal to the superior knowledge of the
            priest. Hence Ezekiel contemplates a perpetuation of the old
            ritual Torah or direction of the priests even in the ideal state
            of things to which his vision looks forward. Although the people
            are assumed to be all righteous in heart and responsive to the
            will of Jehovah, yet they could not all have the professional
            knowledge of ritual laws which was necessary to guide them on all
            occasions, and errors of inadvertence were unavoidable. Jeremiah
            could look forward to a time when none should teach his neighbour
            or his brother, saying, Know Jehovah, because the religion which
            consists in spiritual emotions and affections <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page440">[pg 440]</span><a name="Pg440" id=
            "Pg440" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> becomes the independent
            possession of every one who is the subject of saving grace. But
            Ezekiel, from his point of view, could not anticipate a time when
            all the Lord's people should be priests; for ritual is
            essentially an affair of tradition and technique, and can only be
            maintained by a class of experts specially trained for their
            office. Ritualism and sacerdotalism are natural allies; and it is
            not wholly accidental that the great ritualistic Churches of
            Christendom are those organised on the sacerdotal principle.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But, secondly,
            the priests have to act as judges or arbitrators in cases of
            disagreement between man and man (ver. 24). This again was an
            important department of priestly Torah in ancient Israel, the
            origin of which went back to the personal legislation of Moses in
            the wilderness.<a id="noteref_237" name="noteref_237" href=
            "#note_237"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">237</span></span></a>
            Cases too hard for human judgment were referred to the decision
            of God at the sanctuary, and the judgment was conveyed through
            the agency of the priest. It is impossible to over-estimate the
            service thus rendered by the priesthood to the cause of religion
            in Israel; and Hosea bitterly complains of the defection of the
            priests from the Torah of their God as the source of the
            widespread moral corruption of his time.<a id="noteref_238" name=
            "noteref_238" href="#note_238"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">238</span></span></a> In
            the book of Deuteronomy the Levitical priests of the central
            sanctuary are associated with the civil magistrate as a court of
            ultimate appeal in matters of controversy that arise within the
            community; and this is by no means a tribute to the superior
            legal acumen of the clerical mind, but a reassertion of the old
            principle that the priest is the mouthpiece of Jehovah's
            judgment.<a id="noteref_239" name="noteref_239" href=
            "#note_239"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">239</span></span></a>
            That the priests should be the sole judges in Ezekiel's ideal
            polity was to be expected from the high position assigned to the
            order generally; <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page441">[pg
            441]</span><a name="Pg441" id="Pg441" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            but there is another reason for it. We have once more to keep in
            mind that we are dealing with the Messianic community, when the
            people are anxious to do the right when they know it, and only
            cases of honest perplexity require to be resolved. The priests'
            decision had never been backed up by executive authority, and in
            the kingdom of God no such sanction will be necessary. By this
            simple judicial arrangement the ethical demands of Jehovah's
            holiness will be made effective in the ordinary life of the
            community.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Finally, the
            priests have complete control of public worship, and are
            responsible for the due observance of the festivals and for the
            sanctification of the Sabbath (ver. 24).</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">3. With regard
            to the provisions for the support of the priesthood, the old law
            continues in force that the priests can hold no landed property
            and have no possession like the other tribes of Israel (ver. 28).
            It is true that a strip of land, measuring about twenty-seven
            square miles, was set apart for their residence;<a id=
            "noteref_240" name="noteref_240" href="#note_240"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">240</span></span></a> but
            this was probably not to be cultivated, and at all events it is
            not reckoned as a possession yielding revenue for their
            maintenance. The priests' inheritance is Jehovah Himself, which
            means that they are to live on the offerings of the community
            presented to Jehovah at the sanctuary. In the practice of the
            first Temple this ancient rule appears to have been interpreted
            in a broad and liberal spirit, greatly to the advantage of the
            Zadokite priests. The Temple dues consisted partly of money
            payments by the worshippers; and at least the fines for
            ceremonial trespasses which took the place of the sin- and
            guilt-offerings were counted the lawful perquisites of the
            priests.<a id="noteref_241" name="noteref_241" href=
            "#note_241"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">241</span></span></a>
            Ezekiel knows nothing of this system; <span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page442">[pg 442]</span><a name="Pg442" id="Pg442" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> and if it remained in force down to his
            time, he undoubtedly meant to abolish it. The tribute of the
            sanctuary is to be paid wholly in kind, and out of this the
            priests are to receive a stated allowance. In the first place
            those sacrifices which are wholly made over to the Deity, and yet
            are not consumed on the altar, have to be eaten by the priests in
            a holy place. These are the meal-offering, the sin-offering, and
            the guilt-offering; of which more hereafter. For precisely the
            same reason all that is <span lang="he" class="tei tei-foreign"
            xml:lang="he"><span style=

            <span class="tei tei-q">“devoted”</span> irrevocably to
            Jehovah—becomes the possession of the priests, His
            representatives, except in the cases where it had to be
            absolutely destroyed. Besides this they have a claim to the best
            (an indefinite portion) of the firstfruits and <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“oblations”</span> (<span lang="he" class=
            "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="he"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">terûmah</span></span>) brought to the
            sanctuary in accordance with ancient custom to be consumed by the
            worshipper and his friends.<a id="noteref_242" name="noteref_242"
            href="#note_242"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These
            regulations are undoubtedly based on pre-exilic usages, and
            consequently leave much to be supplied from the people's
            knowledge of use and wont. They do not differ very greatly from
            the enumeration of the priestly dues in the eighteenth chapter of
            Deuteronomy. There, as in Ezekiel, we find that the two great
            sources from which the priests derive their maintenance are the
            sacrifices and the firstfruits. The Deuteronomic Code, however,
            knows nothing of the special class of sacrifices called sin- and
            guilt-offerings, but simply assigns to the priest certain
            portions of each victim,<a id="noteref_243" name="noteref_243"
            href="#note_243"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">243</span></span></a>
            except of course the burnt-offerings, which were consumed entire
            on the altar. The priest's share of natural produce is the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“best”</span> of corn, new wine, oil, and
            wool,<a id="noteref_244" name="noteref_244" href=

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">244</span></span></a> and
            would be selected as a matter of course <span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page443">[pg 443]</span><a name="Pg443" id="Pg443" class=

            sanctuary; so that on this point there is practically complete
            agreement between Ezekiel and Deuteronomy. On the other hand the
            differences of the Levitical legislation are considerable, and
            all in the direction of a fuller provision for the Temple
            establishment. Such an increased provision was called for by the
            peculiar circumstances of the second Temple. The revenue of the
            sanctuary obviously depended on the size and prosperity of the
            constituency to which it ministered. The stipulations of Deut.
            xviii. were no doubt sufficient for the maintenance of the
            priesthood in the old kingdom of Judah; and similarly those of
            Ezekiel's legislation would amply suffice in the ideal condition
            of the people and land presupposed by the vision. But neither
            could have been adequate for the support of a costly ritual in a
            small community like that which returned from Babylon where one
            man in ten was a priest. Accordingly we find that the
            arrangements made under Nehemiah for the endowment of the Temple
            ministry are conformed to the extended provisions of the Priestly
            Code (Neh. x. 32-39).<a id="noteref_245" name="noteref_245" href=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In conclusion,
            let us briefly consider the significance of this great
            institution of the priesthood in Ezekiel's scheme of an ideal
            theocracy. It would of course be an utter mistake to suppose that
            the prophet is merely legislating in the interests of the
            sacerdotal order to which he himself belonged. It was necessary
            for him to insist on the peculiar sanctity and privileges of the
            priests, and to draw a sharp line of division between them and
            ordinary members of the community. But he does this, not in the
            interest of a privileged caste within the nation, but in the
            interest of a religious ideal which embraced priests and people
            alike and had to be realised in the life of the nation as a
            whole. That ideal is expressed by the word <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“holiness,”</span> and we have already seen how the
            idea of holiness demanded ceremonial conditions of immediate
            access to Jehovah's presence which the ordinary Israelite could
            not observe. But <span class="tei tei-q">“exclusion”</span> could
            not possibly be the last word of a religion which seeks to bring
            men into fellowship with God. Access to God might be hedged about
            by <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page445">[pg 445]</span><a name=
            "Pg445" id="Pg445" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> restrictions and
            conditions of the most onerous kind, but access there must be if
            worship was to have any meaning and value for the nation or the
            individual. Although the worshipper might not himself lay his
            victim on the altar, he must at least be permitted to offer his
            gift and receive the assurance that it was accepted. If the
            priest stood between him and God, it was not merely to separate
            but also to mediate between them, and through the fulfilment of
            superior conditions of holiness to establish a communication
            between him and the holy Being whose face he sought. Hence the
            great function of the priesthood in the theocracy is to maintain
            the intercourse between Jehovah and Israel which was exhibited in
            the Temple ritual by acts of sacrificial worship.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now it is
            manifest that this system of ideas rests on the representative
            character of the priestly office. If the principal idea
            symbolised in the sanctuary is that of holiness through
            separation, the fundamental idea of priesthood is holiness
            through representation. It is the holiness of Israel concentrated
            in the priesthood which qualifies the latter for entrance within
            the inner circle of the divine presence. Or perhaps it would be
            more correct to say that the presence of Jehovah first sanctifies
            the priests in an eminent degree, and then through them, though
            in a less degree, the whole body of the people. The idea of
            national solidarity was too deeply rooted in the Hebrew
            consciousness to admit of any other interpretation of the
            priesthood than this. The Israelite did not need to be told that
            his standing before God was secured by his membership in the
            religious community on whose behalf the priests ministered at the
            altar and before the Temple. It would not occur to him to think
            of his personal exclusion from the most sacred offices as a
            religious disability; it was enough for him to know that the
            nation to which he belonged was admitted to the presence of
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page446">[pg 446]</span><a name=
            "Pg446" id="Pg446" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Jehovah in the
            persons of its representatives, and that he as an individual
            shared in the blessings which accrued to Israel through the
            privileged ministry of the priests. Thus to a Temple poet of a
            later age than Ezekiel's the figure of the high priest supplies a
            striking image of the communion of saints and the blessing of
            Jehovah resting on the whole people:—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was remarked
          in a previous lecture that the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“prince”</span> of the closing vision appears to occupy
          a less exalted position than the Messianic king of ch. xxxiv. or
          ch. xxxvii. The grounds on which this impression rests require,
          however, to be carefully considered, if we are not to carry away a
          thoroughly false conception of the theocratic state foreshadowed by
          Ezekiel. It must not be supposed that the prince is a personage of
          less than royal rank, or that his authority is overshadowed by that
          of a priestly caste. He is undoubtedly the civil head of the
          nation, owing no allegiance within his own province to any earthly
          superior. Nor is there any reason to doubt that he is the heir of
          the Davidic house and holds his office in virtue of the divine
          promise which secured the throne to David's descendants. It would
          therefore be a mistake to imagine that we have here an anticipation
          of the Romish theory of the subordination of the secular to the
          spiritual power. It may be true that in the state of things
          presupposed by the vision very little is left for the king to do,
          whilst a variety of important duties falls to the priesthood; but
          at all events the king is there and is supreme in his own sphere.
          Ezekiel does not show the road to Canossa. If the king is
          overshadowed, it is by the personal presence of Jehovah in the
          midst of His people; and that which <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page448">[pg 448]</span><a name="Pg448" id="Pg448" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> limits his prerogative is not the sacerdotal
          power, but the divine constitution of the theocracy as revealed in
          the vision itself, under which both king and priests have their
          functions defined and regulated with a view to the religious ends
          for which the community as a whole exists.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Our purpose in
          the present chapter is to put together the scattered references to
          the duties of the prince which occur in chs. xliv.-xlvi., so as to
          gain as clear a picture as possible of the position of the monarchy
          in the theocratic state. It must be remembered, however, that the
          picture will necessarily be incomplete. National life in its
          secular aspects, with which the king is chiefly concerned, is
          hardly touched on in the vision. Everything being looked upon from
          the point of view of the Temple and its worship, there are but few
          allusions in which we can detect anything of the nature of a civil
          constitution. And these few are introduced incidentally, not for
          their own sake, but to explain some arrangement for securing the
          sanctity of the land or the community. This fact must never be lost
          sight of in judging of Ezekiel's conception of the monarchy. From
          all that appears in these pages we might conclude that the prince
          is a mere ornamental figurehead of the constitution, and that the
          few real duties assigned to him could have been equally well
          performed by a committee of priests or laymen elected for the
          purpose. But this is to forget that outside the range of subjects
          here touched upon there is a whole world of secular interests, of
          political and social action, where the king has his part to play in
          accordance with the precedents furnished by the best days of the
          ancient monarchy.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Let us glance
          first of all at Ezekiel's institutes of the kingdom in its more
          political relations. The notices here are all in the form of
          constitutional checks and safeguards against an arbitrary and
          oppressive exercise of the royal authority. They are instructive,
          not only as showing the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page449">[pg
          449]</span><a name="Pg449" id="Pg449" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          interest which the prophet had in good government and his care for
          the rights of the subject, but also for the light they cast on
          certain administrative methods in force previous to the Exile.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first point
          that calls for attention is the provision made for the maintenance
          of the prince and his court. It would seem that the revenue of the
          prince was to be derived mainly, if not wholly, from a portion of
          territory reserved as his exclusive property in the division of the
          country among the tribes.<a id="noteref_247" name="noteref_247"
          href="#note_247"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">247</span></span></a> These
          crown lands are situated on either side of the sacred <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“oblation”</span> around the sanctuary, set apart for
          the use of the priests and Levites; and they extend to the sea on
          the west and to the Jordan Valley on the east. Out of these he is
          at liberty to assign a possession to his sons in perpetuity, but
          any estate bestowed on his courtiers reverts to the prince in the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“year of liberty.”</span><a id=
          "noteref_248" name="noteref_248" href="#note_248"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">248</span></span></a> The
          object of this last regulation apparently is to prevent the
          formation of a new hereditary aristocracy between the royal family
          and the peasantry. A life peerage, so to speak, or something less,
          is deemed a sufficient reward for the most devoted service to the
          king or the state. And no doubt the certainty of a revision of all
          royal grants every seventh year would tend to keep some persons
          mindful of their duty. The whole system of royal demesnes which the
          king might dispose of as appanages for his younger children or his
          faithful retainers presents a curious resemblance to a well-known
          feature of feudalism in the Middle Ages; but it was never
          practically enforced in Israel. Before the Exile it was evidently
          unknown, and after the Exile there was no king to provide for. But
          why does the prophet bestow so much care on a mere detail of a
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page450">[pg 450]</span><a name=
          "Pg450" id="Pg450" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> political system in
          which, as a whole, he takes so little interest? It is because of
          his concern for the rights of the common people against the
          high-handed tyranny of the king and his nobles. He recalls the bad
          times of the old monarchy when any man was liable to be ejected
          from his land for the benefit of some court favourite, or to
          provide a portion for a younger son of the king. The cruel
          evictions of the poorer peasant proprietors, which all the early
          prophets denounce as an outrage against humanity, and of which the
          story of Naboth furnished a typical example, must be rendered
          impossible in the new Israel; and as the king had no doubt been the
          principal offender in the past, the rule is firmly laid down in his
          case that on no pretext must he take the people's inheritance. And
          this, be it observed, is an application of the religious principle
          which underlies the constitution of the theocracy. The land is
          Jehovah's, and all interference with the ancient landmarks which
          guard the rights of private ownership is an offence against the
          holiness of the true divine King who has His abode amongst the
          tribes of Israel. This suggests developments of the idea of
          holiness which reach to the very foundations of social well-being.
          A conception of holiness which secures each man in the possession
          of his own vine and fig tree is at all events not open to the
          charge of ignoring the practical interests of common life for the
          sake of an unprofitable ceremonialism.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the next
          place, we come across a much more startling revelation of the
          injustice habitually practised by the Hebrew monarchs. Just as
          later sovereigns were wont to meet their deficits by debasing the
          currency, so the kings of Judah had learned to augment their
          revenue by a systematic falsification of weights and measures. We
          know from the prophet Amos<a id="noteref_249" name="noteref_249"
          href="#note_249"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">249</span></span></a> that
          this was a common <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page451">[pg
          451]</span><a name="Pg451" id="Pg451" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          trick of the wealthy landowners who sold grain at exorbitant prices
          to the poor whom they had driven from their possessions. They
          <span class="tei tei-q">“made the ephah small and the shekel great,
          and dealt falsely with balances of deceit.”</span> But it was left
          for Ezekiel to tell us that the same fraud was a regular part of
          the fiscal system of the Judæan kingdom. There is no mistaking the
          meaning of his accusation: <span class="tei tei-q">“Have done, O
          princes of Israel, with your violent and oppressive rule; execute
          judgment and justice, and take away your exactions from My people,
          saith Jehovah God. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Ye shall have just balances, and a just ephah,
          and a just bath.</span></em>”</span><a id="noteref_250" name=
          "noteref_250" href="#note_250"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">250</span></span></a> That
          is to say, the taxes were surreptitiously increased by the use of a
          large shekel (for weighing out money payments) and a large bath and
          ephah (for measuring tribute paid in kind). And if it was
          impossible for the poor to protect themselves against the rapacity
          of private dealers, poor and rich alike were helpless when the
          fraud was openly practised in the king's name. This Ezekiel had
          seen with his own eyes, and the shameful injustice of it was so
          branded on his spirit that even in a vision of the last days it
          comes back to him as an evil to be sedulously guarded against. It
          was eminently a case for legislation. If there was to be such a
          thing as fair dealing and commercial probity in the community, the
          system of weights and measurement must be fixed beyond the power of
          the royal caprice to alter it. It was as sacred as any principle of
          the constitution. Accordingly he finds a place in his legislation
          for a corrected scale of weights and measures, restored no doubt to
          their original values. The ephah for dry measure and the bath for
          liquid measure are each fixed at <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          the Law of Holiness an ordinance very similar to Ezekiel's occurs
          amongst the conditions by which the precept is to be fulfilled:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Be ye holy, for I am holy.”</span><a id=
          "noteref_254" name="noteref_254" href="#note_254"><span class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">254</span></span></a> It is
          evident that the Israelites had learned to regard with a religious
          abhorrence all tampering with the fixed standards of value on which
          the purity of commercial life depended. To overreach by lying words
          was a sin; but to cheat by the use of a false balance was a species
          of profanity comparable to a false oath in the name of Jehovah.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These rules
          about weights and measures required, however, to be supplemented by
          a fixed tariff, regulating the taxes which the prince might impose
          on the people.<a id="noteref_255" name="noteref_255" href=
          "#note_255"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">255</span></span></a> It is
          not quite clear whether any part of the prince's own income was to
          be derived from taxation. The tribute is called an <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“oblation,”</span> and there is no doubt that it was
          intended principally for the support of the Temple ritual, which in
          any case must have been the heaviest charge on the royal exchequer.
          But the oblation was rendered to the prince in the first instance;
          and the prophet's anxiety to prevent unjust exactions springs from
          a fear that the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page453">[pg
          453]</span><a name="Pg453" id="Pg453" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          king might make the Temple tax a pretext for increasing his own
          revenue. At all events the people's duty to contribute to the
          support of public ordinances according to their ability is here
          explicitly recognised. Compared with the provision of the Levitical
          law the scale of charges here proposed must be pronounced extremely
          moderate. The contribution of each householder varies from
          one-sixtieth to one-twohundredth of his income and is wholly paid
          in kind.<a id="noteref_256" name="noteref_256" href=

          proper equivalent under the second Temple of Ezekiel's <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“oblation”</span> was a poll-tax of one-third of a
          shekel, voluntarily undertaken at the time of Nehemiah's covenant
          <span class="tei tei-q">“for the service of the house of our God;
          for the shewbread and for the continual meal-offering, and for the
          continual burnt-offering, of the Sabbaths, of the new moons, for
          the set feasts, and for the holy things, and for the sin-offerings
          to make atonement for Israel, and for all the work of the house of
          our God.”</span><a id="noteref_257" name="noteref_257" href=

          in addition to this money payment the law required a tenth of all
          produce of the soil and the flock to be given to the priests and
          Levites. In Ezekiel's legislation the tithes and firstfruits are
          still left for the use of the owner, who is expected to consume
          them in sacrificial feasts at the sanctuary. The only charge,
          therefore, of the nature of a fixed tribute for religious purposes
          is the oblation here required for the regular sacrifices which
          represent the stated worship rendered on behalf of the community as
          a whole.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page454">[pg
          454]</span><a name="Pg454" id="Pg454" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This brings us
          now to the more important aspect of the kingly office—its religious
          privileges and duties. Here there are three points which require to
          be noticed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">1. In the first
          place it is the duty of the prince to supply the material of the
          public sacrifices offered in the name of the people.<a id=
          "noteref_259" name="noteref_259" href="#note_259"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">259</span></span></a> Out
          of the tribute levied on the people for this purpose he has to
          furnish the altar with the stated number of victims for the daily
          service, the Sabbaths, and new moons, and the great yearly
          festivals. It is clear that some one must be charged with the
          responsibility of this important part of the worship, and it is
          significant of Ezekiel's relations to the past that the duty does
          not yet devolve directly on the priests. They seem to exercise no
          authority outside of the Temple, the king standing between them and
          the community as a sort of patron of the sanctuary. But the
          position of the prince is not simply that of an official receiver,
          collecting the tribute, and then handing it over to the Temple as
          it was required. He is the representative of the religious unity of
          the nation, and in this capacity he presents in person the regular
          sacrifices offered on behalf of the community. Thus on the day of
          the Passover he presents a sin-offering for himself and the
          people,<a id="noteref_260" name="noteref_260" href=
          "#note_260"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">260</span></span></a> as
          the high priest does in the ceremonial of the Great Day of
          Atonement.<a id="noteref_261" name="noteref_261" href=
          "#note_261"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">261</span></span></a> And
          so all the sacrifices of the stated ritual are his sacrifices,
          officiating as the head of the nation in its acts of common
          worship. In this respect the prince succeeds to the rights
          exercised by the kings of Judah in the ritual of the first Temple,
          although on a different footing. Before the Exile the king had a
          proprietary interest in the central sanctuary, and the expense of
          the stated service was defrayed as a matter of course out of the
          royal revenues. Part of this revenue, as we see <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page455">[pg 455]</span><a name="Pg455" id="Pg455"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> in the case of Joash, was raised by a
          system of Temple dues paid by the worshippers and expended on the
          repairs of the house; but at a much later date than this we find
          Ahaz assuming absolute control over the daily sacrifices,<a id=
          "noteref_262" name="noteref_262" href="#note_262"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">262</span></span></a> which
          were doubtless maintained at his expense.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now the tendency
          of Ezekiel's legislation is to bring the whole community into a
          closer and more personal connection with the worship of the
          sanctuary, and to leave no part of it subject to the arbitrary will
          of the prince. But still the idea is preserved that the prince is
          the religious as well as the civil representative of the nation;
          and although he is deprived of all control over the performance of
          the ritual, he is still required to provide the public sacrifices
          and to offer them in the name of his people.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">2. In virtue of
          his representative character the prince possesses certain
          privileges in his approaches to God in the sanctuary not accorded
          to ordinary worshippers. In this connection it is necessary to
          explain some details regulating the use of the sanctuary by the
          people. The outer court might be entered by prince or people either
          through the north or south gate, but not from the east. The eastern
          gate was that by which Jehovah had entered His dwelling-place, and
          the doors of it are for ever closed. No foot might cross its
          threshold. But the prince—and this is one of his peculiar
          rights—might enter the gateway from the court to eat his
          sacrificial meals.<a id="noteref_263" name="noteref_263" href=
          "#note_263"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">263</span></span></a> It
          seems therefore to have served the same purpose for the prince as
          the thirty cells along the wall did for common worshippers. The
          east gate of the inner court was also shut as a rule, and was
          probably never used as a passage even by the priests. But on the
          Sabbaths and new moons it was thrown open to receive the sacrifices
          which the prince <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page456">[pg
          456]</span><a name="Pg456" id="Pg456" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          had to bring on these days, and it remained open till the evening.
          On days when the gate was open the worshipping congregation
          assembled at its door, while the prince entered as far as the
          threshold and looked on while the priests presented his offering;
          then he went out by the way he had entered. If on any other
          occasion he presented a voluntary sacrifice in his private
          capacity, the east gate was opened for him as before, but was shut
          as soon as the ceremony was over. On those occasions when the
          eastern gate was not opened, as at the great annual festivals, the
          people probably gathered round the north and south gates, from
          which they could see the altar; and at these seasons the prince
          enters and departs in the common throng of worshippers. A very
          peculiar regulation, for which no obvious reason appears, is that
          each man must leave the Temple by the gate opposite to that at
          which he entered; if he entered by the north, he must leave by the
          south, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">vice versâ</span></span>.<a id="noteref_264"
          name="noteref_264" href="#note_264"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">264</span></span></a></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Many of these
          arrangements were no doubt suggested by Ezekiel's acquaintance with
          the practice in the first Temple, and their precise object is lost
          to us. But one or two facts stand out clearly enough, and are very
          instructive as to the whole conception of Temple worship. The chief
          thing to be noticed is that the principal sacrifices are
          representative. The people are merely spectators of a transaction
          with God on their behalf, the efficacy of which in no way depends
          on their co-operation. Standing <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page457">[pg 457]</span><a name="Pg457" id="Pg457" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> at the gates of the inner court, they see the
          priests performing the sacred ministrations; they bow themselves in
          humble reverence before the presence of the Most High; and these
          acts of devotion may have been of the utmost importance for the
          religious life of the individual Israelite. But the congregation
          takes no real part in the worship; it is done for them, but not by
          them; it is an <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
          "la"><span style="font-style: italic">opus operatum</span></span>
          performed by the prince and the priests for the good of the
          community, and is equally necessary and equally valid whether there
          is a congregation present to witness it or not. Those who attend
          are themselves but representatives of the nation of Israel, in
          whose interest the ritual is kept up. But the supreme
          representative of the people is the king, and we note how
          everything is done to emphasise his peculiar dignity within the
          sanctuary. It was necessary perhaps to do something to compensate
          for the loss of distinction caused by the exclusion of the royal
          body-guard from the Temple. The prince is still the one conspicuous
          figure in the outer court. Even his private sacrificial meals are
          eaten in solitary state, in the eastern gateway, which is used for
          no other purpose. And in the great functions where the prince
          appears in his representative character he approaches nearer to the
          altar than is permitted to any other layman. He ascends the steps
          of the eastern gateway in the sight of the people, and passing
          through he presents his offerings on the verge of the inner court
          which none but the priests may enter. His whole position is thus
          one of great importance in the celebration of public ordinances. In
          detail his functions are no doubt determined by ancient
          prescriptive usages not known to us, but modified in accordance
          with the stricter ideal of holiness which Ezekiel's vision was
          intended to enforce.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">3. Finally, we
          have to observe that the prince is rigorously excluded from
          properly priestly offices. It is <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page458">[pg 458]</span><a name="Pg458" id="Pg458" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> true that in some respects his position is
          analogous to that of the high priest under the law. But the analogy
          extends only to that aspect of the high priest's functions in which
          he appears as the head and representative of the religious
          community, and ceases the moment he enters upon priestly duties. So
          far as the special degree of sanctity which characterises the
          priesthood is concerned, the prince is a layman, and as such he is
          jealously debarred from approaching the altar, and even from
          intruding into the sacred inner court where the priests minister.
          Now this fact has perhaps a deeper historical importance than we
          are apt to imagine. There is good reason to believe that in the old
          Temple the kings of Judah frequently officiated in person at the
          altar. At the time when the monarchy was established it was the
          rule that any man might sacrifice for himself and his household,
          and that the king as the representative of the nation should
          sacrifice on its behalf was an extension of the principle too
          obvious to require express sanction. Accordingly we find that both
          Saul and David on public occasions built altars and offered
          sacrifice to Jehovah. The older theory indeed seems to have been
          that priestly rights were inherent in the kingly office, and that
          the acting priests were the ministers to whom the king delegated
          the greater part of his priestly functions. Although the king might
          not appoint any one to this duty without respect to the Levitical
          qualification, he exercised within certain limits the right of
          deposing one family and installing another in the priesthood of the
          royal sanctuary. The house of Zadok itself owed its position to
          such an act of ecclesiastical authority on the part of David and
          Solomon.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The last
          occasion on which we read of a king of Judah officiating in person
          in the Temple is at the dedication of the new altar of Ahaz, when
          the king not only himself sacrificed, but gave directions to the
          priests <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page459">[pg
          459]</span><a name="Pg459" id="Pg459" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          as to the future observance of the ritual. The occasion was no
          doubt unusual, but there is not a word in the narrative to indicate
          that the king was committing an irregular action or exceeding the
          recognised prerogatives of his position. It would be unsafe,
          however, to conclude that this state of things continued unchanged
          till the close of the monarchy. After the time of Isaiah the Temple
          rose greatly in the religious estimation of the people, and a very
          probable result of this would be an increasing sense of the
          importance of the ministration of the official priesthood. The
          silence of the historical books and of Deuteronomy may not count
          for much in an argument on this question; but Ezekiel's own
          decisions lack the emphasis and solemnity with which he introduces
          an absolute innovation like the separation between priests and
          Levites in ch. xliv. It is at least possible that the later kings
          had gradually ceased to exercise the right of sacrifice, so that
          the privilege had lapsed through desuetude. Nevertheless it was a
          great step to have the principle affirmed as a fundamental law of
          the theocracy; and this Ezekiel undoubtedly does. If no other
          practical object were gained, it served at least to illustrate in
          the most emphatic way the idea of holiness, which demanded the
          exclusion of every layman from unhallowed contact with the most
          sacred emblems of Jehovah's presence.</p>

          <div class="tei tei-tb">
            <hr style="width: 50%" />
          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It will be seen
          from all that has been said that the real interest of Ezekiel's
          treatment of the monarchy lies far apart from modern problems which
          might seem to have a superficial affinity with it. No lessons can
          fairly be deduced from it on the relations between Church and
          State, or the propriety of endowing and establishing the Christian
          religion, or the duty of rulers to maintain ordinances for the
          benefit of their subjects. Its importance lies in another
          direction. It shows the transition in Israel from <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page460">[pg 460]</span><a name="Pg460" id="Pg460"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> a state of things in which the king is
          both <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
          "la"><span style="font-style: italic">de jure</span></span> and
          <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">de facto</span></span> the source of power and
          the representative of the nation and where his religious status is
          the natural consequence of his civic dignity, to a very different
          state of things, where the forms of the ancient constitution are
          retained although the power has largely vanished from them. The
          prince now requires to have his religious duties imposed on him by
          an abstract political system whose sole sanction is the authority
          of the Deity. It is a transition which has no precise parallel
          anywhere else, although resemblances more or less instructive might
          doubtless be instanced from the history of Catholicism. Nowhere
          does Ezekiel's idealism appear more wonderfully blended with his
          equally characteristic conservatism than here. There is no real
          trace of the tendency attributed to the prophet to exalt the
          priesthood at the expense of the monarchy. The prince is after all
          a much more imposing personage even in the ceremonial worship than
          any priest. Although he lacks the priestly quality of holiness, his
          duties are quite as important as those of the priests, while his
          dignity is far greater than theirs. The considerations that enter
          in to limit his power and importance come from another quarter.
          They are such as these: first, the loss of military leadership,
          which is at least to be presumed in the circumstances of the
          Messianic kingdom; second, the welfare of the people at large; and
          third, the principle of holiness, whose supremacy has to be
          vindicated in the person of the king no less than in that of his
          meanest subject.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Perhaps the most
          remarkable thing is that the transition referred to was not
          actually accomplished even in the history of Israel itself. It was
          only in a vision that the monarchy was ever to be represented in
          the form which it bears here. From the time of Ezekiel no native
          king was ever to rule over Israel again save the priest-princes
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page461">[pg 461]</span><a name=
          "Pg461" id="Pg461" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of the Asmonean
          dynasty, whose constitutional position was defined by their
          high-priestly dignity. Ezekiel's vision is therefore a preparation
          for the kingless state of post-exilic Judaism. The foreign
          potentates to whom the Jews were subject did in some instances
          provide materials for the Temple worship, but their local
          representatives were of course unqualified to fill the position
          assigned to the prince by the great prophet of the Exile. The
          community had to get along as best it could without a king, and the
          task was not difficult. The Temple dues were paid directly to the
          priests and Levites, and the function of representing the community
          before the altar was assigned to the High Priest. It was then
          indeed that the High Priesthood came to the front and blossomed out
          into all the magnificence of its legal position. It was not only
          the religious part of the prince's duties that fell to it, but a
          considerable share of his political importance as well. As the only
          hereditary institution that had survived the Exile, it naturally
          became the chief centre of social order in the community. By
          degrees the Persian and Greek kings found it expedient to deal with
          the Jews through the High Priest, whose authority they were bound
          to respect, and thus to leave him a free hand in the internal
          affairs of the commonwealth. The High Priesthood, in fact, was a
          civil as well as a priestly dignity. We can see that this great
          revolution would have broken the continuity of Hebrew history far
          more violently than it did, but for the stepping-stone furnished by
          the ideal <span class="tei tei-q">“prince”</span> of Ezekiel's
          vision.</p>

          the slaughter of an animal, or at least the presentation of a
          material offering of some sort, should ever have been considered of
          the essence of intercourse with the Deity may seem to us incredible
          in the light of the idea of God which we now possess. Yet there can
          be no doubt that there was a stage of religious development which
          recognised no true approach to God except as consummated in a
          sacrificial action. The word <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“sacrifice”</span> itself preserves a memorial of this
          crude and early type of religious service. Etymologically it
          denotes nothing more than a sacred act. But amongst the Romans, as
          amongst ourselves, it was regularly applied to the offerings at the
          altar, which were thus marked out as <em class=

          sacred actions <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          religion. It would be impossible to explain the extraordinary
          persistence and vitality of the institution amongst races that had
          attained a relatively high degree of civilisation, unless we
          understand that the ideas connected with it go back to a time when
          sacrifice was the typical and fundamental form of primitive
          worship.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page463">[pg

          Ezekiel, however, the age of sacrifice in this strict and absolute
          sense may be said to have passed away, at least in principle.
          Devout Jews who had lived through the captivity in Babylon and
          found that Jehovah was there to them <span class="tei tei-q">“a

          not possibly fall back into the belief that their God was only to
          be approached and found through the ritual of the altar. And long
          before the Exile, the ethical teaching of the prophets had led
          Israel to appreciate the external rites of sacrifice at their true
          value.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This great word
          of spiritual religion had been uttered long before Ezekiel, as a
          protest against the senseless multiplication of sacrifices which
          came in in the reign of Manasseh. Nor can we suppose that Ezekiel,
          with all his engrossment in matters of ritual, was insensible to
          the lofty teaching of his predecessors, or that his conception of
          God was less spiritual than theirs. As a matter of fact the worship
          of Israel was never afterwards wholly absorbed in the routine of
          the Temple ceremonies. The institution of the synagogue with its
          purely devotional exercises of prayer and reading of the Scriptures
          must have been nearly coeval with the second Temple, and prepared
          the way far more than the latter for the spiritual worship
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page464">[pg 464]</span><a name=
          "Pg464" id="Pg464" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of the New
          Testament. But even the Temple worship was spiritualised by the
          service of praise and the marvellous development of devotional
          poetry which it called forth. <span class="tei tei-q">“The emotion
          with which the worshipper approaches the second Temple, as recorded
          in the Psalter, has little to do with sacrifice, but rests rather
          on the fact that the whole wondrous history of Jehovah's grace to
          Israel is vividly and personally realised as he stands amidst the
          festal crowd at the ancient seat of God's throne, and adds his
          voice to the swelling song of praise.”</span><a id="noteref_268"
          name="noteref_268" href="#note_268"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">268</span></span></a></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">How then, it may
          be asked, are we to account for the fact that the prophet shows
          such intense interest in the details of a system which was already
          losing its religious significance? If sacrifice was no longer of
          the essence of worship, why should he be so careful to legislate
          for a scheme of ritual in which sacrifice is the prominent feature,
          and say nothing of the inward state of heart which alone is an
          acceptable offering to God? The chief reason no doubt is that the
          ritual elements of religion were the only matters, apart from moral
          duties, which admitted of being reduced to a legal system, and that
          the formation of such a system was demanded by the circumstances
          with which the prophet had to deal. The time was not yet come when
          the principle of a central national sanctuary could be abandoned,
          and if such a sanctuary was to be maintained without danger to the
          highest interests of religion it was necessary that its service
          should be regulated with a view to preserve the deposit of revealed
          truth that had been committed to the nation through the prophets.
          The essential features of the sacrificial institutions were charged
          with a deep religious significance, and there existed in the
          popular mind a great mass of sound religious impression and
          sentiment clustering around that central <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page465">[pg 465]</span><a name="Pg465" id="Pg465" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> rite. To dispense with the institution of
          sacrifice would have rendered worship entirely impossible for the
          great body of the people, while to leave it unregulated was to
          invite a recurrence of the abuses which had been so fruitful a
          source of corruption in the past. Hence the object of the ritual
          ordinances which we are about to consider is twofold: in the first
          place to provide an authorised code of ritual free from everything
          that savoured of pagan usages, and in the second to utilise the
          public worship as a means of deepening and purifying the religious
          conceptions of those who could be influenced in no other way.
          Ezekiel's legislation has a special regard for the wants of the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“common rude man”</span> whose religious
          life needs all the help it can get from external observances. Such
          persons form the majority of every religious society; and to train
          their minds to a deeper sense of sin and a more vivid apprehension
          of the divine holiness proved to be the only way in which the
          spiritual teaching of the prophets could be made a practical power
          in the community at large. It is true that the highest spiritual
          needs were not satisfied by the legal ritual. But the irrepressible
          longings of the soul for nearer fellowship with God cannot be dealt
          with by rigid formal enactments. Ezekiel is content to leave them
          to the guidance of that Spirit whose saving operations will have
          changed the heart of Israel and made it a true people of God. The
          system of external observances which he foreshadows in his vision
          was not meant to be the life of religion, but it was, so to speak,
          the trellis-work which was necessary to support the delicate
          tendrils of spiritual piety until the time when the spirit of
          filial worship should be the possession of every true member of the
          Church of God.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Bearing these
          facts in mind, we may now proceed to examine the scheme of
          sacrificial worship contained in chapters xlv. and xlvi. Only its
          leading features can here <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page466">[pg
          466]</span><a name="Pg466" id="Pg466" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          be noticed, and the points most deserving of attention may be
          grouped under three heads: the Festivals, the Representative
          Service, and the Idea of Atonement.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I. <span class=

          the division of the ecclesiastical year into two precisely similar
          parts. Each half of the year commences with an atoning sacrifice
          for the purification of the sanctuary from defilement contracted
          during the previous half.<a id="noteref_270" name="noteref_270"

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">270</span></span></a> Each

          on the fourteenth day of the first month and lasting seven days,
          and in the other the Feast of Tabernacles (simply called the
          Feast), beginning on the fifteenth day of the seventh month and
          also lasting for seven days.<a id="noteref_271" name="noteref_271"

          passage is chiefly devoted to a minute regulation of the public
          sacrifices to be offered on these occasions, other and more
          characteristic features of the celebration being assumed as well
          known from tradition.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is difficult
          to see what is the precise meaning of the proposed rearrangement of
          the feasts in two parallel series. It may be due simply to the
          prophet's love of symmetry in all departments of public life, or it
          may have been suggested by the fact that at this time the
          Babylonian calendar, according to which the year begins in spring,
          was superimposed on the old Hebrew year commencing in the
          autumn.<a id="noteref_272" name="noteref_272" href=
          "#note_272"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          all events it involved a breach with pre-exilic tradition, and was
          never carried <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page467">[pg
          467]</span><a name="Pg467" id="Pg467" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          out in practice. The earlier legislation of the Pentateuch
          recognises a cycle of three festivals—Passover and Unleavened
          Bread, the Feast of Harvest or of Weeks (Pentecost), and the Feast
          of Ingathering or of Tabernacles.<a id="noteref_273" name=
          "noteref_273" href="#note_273"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">273</span></span></a> In
          order to carry through his symmetrical division of the sacred year
          Ezekiel has to ignore one of these, the Feast of Pentecost, which
          seems to have always been counted the least important of the three.
          It is not to be supposed that he contemplated its abolition, for he
          is careful not to alter in any particular the positive regulations
          of Deuteronomy; only it did not fall into his scheme, and so he
          does not think it of sufficient importance to prescribe regular
          public sacrifices for it. After the Exile, however, Jewish practice
          was regulated by the canons of the Priestly Code, in which, along
          with other festivals, the ancient threefold cycle is continued, and
          stated sacrifices are prescribed for Pentecost, just as for the
          other two.<a id="noteref_274" name="noteref_274" href=
          "#note_274"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">274</span></span></a>
          Similarly, the two atoning ceremonies in the beginning of the first
          and seventh months,<a id="noteref_275" name="noteref_275" href=
          "#note_275"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">275</span></span></a> which
          are not mentioned in the older legislation, are replaced in the
          Priests' Code by the single Day of Atonement on the tenth day of
          the seventh month, whilst the beginning of the year is celebrated
          by the Feast of Trumpets on the first day of the same month.<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But although the
          details of Ezekiel's system thus proved to be impracticable in the
          circumstances of the restored Jewish community, it succeeded in the
          far more important object of infusing a new spirit into the
          celebration of the feasts, and impressing on them a different
          character. The ancient Hebrew festivals were all associated with
          joyous incidents of the agricultural year. The Feast of Unleavened
          Bread marked the beginning of harvest, when <span class=

          this time also the firstlings of the flock and herd were
          sacrificed. The seven weeks which elapse till Pentecost are the
          season of the cereal harvest, which is then brought to a close by
          the Feast of Harvest, when the goodness of Jehovah is acknowledged
          by the presentation of part of the produce at the sanctuary.
          Finally the Feast of Tabernacles celebrates the most joyous
          occasion of the year, the storing of the produce of the winepress
          and the threshing-floor.<a id="noteref_278" name="noteref_278"
          href="#note_278"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">278</span></span></a> The
          nature of the festivals is easily seen from the events with which
          they are thus associated. They are occasions of social mirth and
          festivity, and the religious rites observed are the expressions of
          the nation's heart-felt gratitude to Jehovah for the blessing that
          has rested on the labours of husbandman and shepherd throughout the
          year. The Passover with its memories of anxiety and escape was no
          doubt of a more sombre character than the others, but the joyous
          and festive nature of Pentecost and Tabernacles is strongly
          insisted on in the book of Deuteronomy. By these institutions
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page469">[pg 469]</span><a name=
          "Pg469" id="Pg469" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> religion was closely
          intertwined with the great interests of every-day life, and the
          fact that the sacred seasons of the Israelites' year were the
          occasions on which the natural joy of life was at its fullest,
          bears witness to the simple-minded piety which was fostered by the
          old Hebrew worship. There was, however, a danger that in such a
          state of things religion should be altogether lost sight of in the
          exuberance of natural hilarity and expressions of social good-will.
          And indeed no great height of spirituality could be nourished by a
          type of worship in which devotional feeling was concentrated on the
          expression of gratitude to God for the bountiful gifts of His
          providence. It was good for the childhood of the nation, but when
          the nation became a man it must put away childish things.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The tendency of
          the post-exilic ritual was to detach the sacred seasons more and
          more from the secular associations which had once been their chief
          significance. This was done partly by the addition of new festivals
          which had no such natural occasion, and partly by a change in the
          point of view from which the older celebrations were regarded. No
          attempt was made to obliterate the traces of the affinity with
          events of common life which endeared them to the hearts of the
          people, but increasing importance was attached to their historic
          significance as memorials of Jehovah's gracious dealings with the
          nation in the period of the Exodus. At the same time they take on
          more and more the character of religious symbols of the permanent
          relations between Jehovah and His people. The beginnings of this
          process can be clearly discerned in the legislation of Ezekiel. Not
          indeed in the direction of a historic interpretation of the feasts,
          for this is ignored even in the case of the Passover, where it was
          already firmly established in the national consciousness. But the
          institution of a special <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page470">[pg
          470]</span><a name="Pg470" id="Pg470" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          series of public sacrifices, which was the same for the Passover
          and the Feast of Tabernacles, and particularly the prominence given
          to the sin-offering, obviously tended to draw the mind of the
          people away from the passing interest of the occasion, and fix it
          on those standing obligations imposed by the holiness of Jehovah on
          which the continuance of all His bounties depended. We cannot be
          mistaken in thinking that one design of the new ritual was to
          correct the excesses of unrestrained animal enjoyment by deepening
          the sense of guilt and the fear of possible offences against the
          sanctity of the divine presence. For it was at these festivals that
          the prince was required to offer the atoning sacrifice for himself
          and the people.<a id="noteref_279" name="noteref_279" href=
          "#note_279"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">279</span></span></a> Thus
          the effect of the whole system was to foster the sensitive and
          tremulous tone of piety which was characteristic of Judaism, in
          contrast to the hearty, if undisciplined, religion of the ancient
          Hebrew feasts.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">II. <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">The Stated
          Service.</span></span>—In the course of this chapter we have had
          occasion more than once to touch on the prominence given in
          Ezekiel's vision to sacrifices offered in accordance with a fixed
          rubric in the name of the whole community. The significance of this
          fact may best be seen from a comparison with the sacrificial
          regulations of the book of Deuteronomy. These are not numerous, but
          they deal exclusively with private sacrifices. The person addressed
          is the individual householder, and the sacrifices which he is
          enjoined to render are for himself and his family. There is no
          explicit allusion in the whole book to the official sacrifices
          which were offered by the regular priesthood and maintained at the
          king's expense. In Ezekiel's scheme of Temple worship the case is
          exactly the reverse. Here there is no mention of <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page471">[pg 471]</span><a name="Pg471" id="Pg471"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> private sacrifice except in the
          incidental notices as to the free-will offerings and the
          sacrificial meal of the prince,<a id="noteref_280" name=
          "noteref_280" href="#note_280"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">280</span></span></a> while
          on the other hand great attention is paid to the maintenance of the
          regular offerings provided by the prince for the congregation. This
          of course does not mean that there were no statutory sacrifices in
          the old Temple, or that Ezekiel contemplated the cessation of
          private sacrifice in the new. Deuteronomy passes over the public
          sacrifices because they were under the jurisdiction of the king,
          and the people at large were not directly responsible for them; and
          similarly Ezekiel is silent as to private offerings because their
          observance was assured by all the traditions of the sanctuary.
          Still it is a noteworthy fact that of two codes of Temple worship,
          separated by only half a century, each legislates exclusively for
          that element of the ritual which is taken for granted by the
          other.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What it
          indicates is nothing less than a change in the ruling conception of
          public worship. Before the Exile the idea that Jehovah could desert
          His sanctuary hardly entered into the mind of the people, and
          certainly did not in the least affect the confidence with which
          they availed themselves of the privileges of worship. The Temple
          was there and God was present within it, and all that was necessary
          was that the spontaneous devotion of the worshippers should be
          regulated by the essential conditions of ceremonial propriety. But
          the destruction of the Temple had proved that the mere existence of
          a sanctuary was no guarantee of the favour and protection of the
          God who was supposed to dwell within it. Jehovah might be driven
          from His Temple by the presence of sin among the people, or even by
          a neglect of the ceremonial precautions which were necessary to
          guard against the profanation of His <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page472">[pg 472]</span><a name="Pg472" id="Pg472" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> holiness. On this idea the whole edifice of
          the later ritual is built up, and here as in other respects Ezekiel
          has shown the way. In his view the validity and efficiency of the
          whole Temple service hangs on the due performance of the public
          rites which preserve the nation in a condition of sanctity and
          continually represent it as a holy people before God. Under cover
          of this representative service the individual may draw near with
          confidence to seek the face of his God in acts of private homage,
          but apart from the regular official ceremonial his worship has no
          reality, because he can have no assurance that Jehovah will accept
          his offering. His right of access to God springs from his
          fellowship with the religious community of Israel, and hence the
          indispensable presupposition of every act of worship is that the
          standing of the community before Jehovah be preserved intact by the
          rites appointed for that purpose. And, as has been already said,
          these rites are representative in character. Being performed on
          behalf of the nation, the obligation of presenting them rests with
          the prince in his representative capacity, and the share of the
          people in them is indicated by the tribute which the prince is
          empowered to levy for this end. In this way the ideal unity of the
          nation finds continual expression in the worship of the sanctuary,
          and the supreme interest of religion is transferred from the mere
          act of personal homage to the abiding conditions of acceptance with
          God symbolised by the stated service.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Let us now look
          at some details of the scheme in which this important idea is
          embodied. The foundation of the whole system is the daily
          burnt-offering—the <span lang="he" class="tei tei-foreign"
          xml:lang="he"><span style="font-style: italic">tāmîd</span></span>.
          Under the first Temple the daily offering seems to have been a
          burnt-offering in the morning and a meal-offering (<span lang="he"
          class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="he"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">minhah</span></span>) in the evening,<a id=
          "noteref_281" name="noteref_281" href="#note_281"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">281</span></span></a> and
          this practice seems to have continued down to the time of
          Ezra.<a id="noteref_282" name="noteref_282" href=
          "#note_282"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">282</span></span></a>
          According to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page473">[pg
          473]</span><a name="Pg473" id="Pg473" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          the Levitical law it consists of a lamb morning and evening,
          accompanied on each occasion by a minhah and a libation of
          wine.<a id="noteref_283" name="noteref_283" href=
          "#note_283"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">283</span></span></a>
          Ezekiel's ordinance occupies a middle position between these two.
          Here the tamîd is a lamb for a burnt-offering in the morning, along
          with a minhah of flour mingled with oil; and there is no provision
          for an evening sacrifice.<a id="noteref_284" name="noteref_284"
          href="#note_284"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">284</span></span></a> The
          presentation of this sacrifice on the altar in the morning, as the
          basis on which all other offerings through the day were laid, may
          be taken to symbolise the truth that the acceptance of all ordinary
          acts of worship depended on the representation of the community
          before God in the regular service. To the spiritual perception of a
          Psalmist it may have suggested the duty of commencing each day's
          work with an act of devotion:—</p>

            </div>
          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The offerings
          for the Sabbaths and new moons may be considered as amplifications
          of the daily sacrifice. They consist exclusively of
          burnt-offerings. On the Sabbath six lambs are presented, perhaps
          one for each working day of the week, together with a ram for the
          Sabbath itself (Smend). At the new moon feast this offering is
          repeated with the addition of a bullock. It may be noted here once
          for all that each burnt sacrifice is accompanied by a corresponding
          minhah, according to a fixed scale. For sin-offerings, on the other
          hand, no minhah seems to be appointed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the annual
          (or rather half-yearly) celebrations the <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page474">[pg 474]</span><a name="Pg474" id="Pg474" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> sin-offering appears for the first time among
          the stated sacrifices. The sacrifice for the cleansing of the
          sanctuary at the beginning of each half of the year consists of a
          young bullock for a sin-offering, in addition of course to the
          burnt-offerings which were prescribed for the first day of the
          month. For the Passover and the Feast of Tabernacles the daily
          offering is a he-goat for a sin-offering, and seven bullocks and
          seven rams for a burnt-offering during the week covered by these
          festivals. Besides this, at Passover, and probably also at
          Tabernacles, the prince presents a bullock as a sin-offering for
          himself and the people. We have now to consider more particularly
          the place which this class of sacrifices occupies in the
          ritual.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">III.
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">Atoning Sacrifices.</span></span>—It is
          evident, even from this short survey, that the idea of atonement
          holds a conspicuous place in the symbolism of Ezekiel's Temple. He
          is, indeed, the earliest writer (setting aside the Levitical Code)
          who mentions the special class of sacrifices known as sin- and
          guilt-offerings. Under the first Temple ceremonial offences were
          regularly atoned for at one time by money payments to the priests,
          and these fines are called by the names afterwards applied to the
          expiatory sacrifices.<a id="noteref_286" name="noteref_286" href=
          "#note_286"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">286</span></span></a> It
          does not follow, of course, that such sacrifices were unknown
          before the time of Ezekiel, nor is such a conclusion probable in
          itself. The manner in which the prophet alludes to them rather
          shows that the idea was perfectly familiar to his contemporaries.
          But the prominence of the sin-offering in the public ritual may be
          safely set down as a new departure in the Temple service, as it is
          one of the most striking symptoms of the change that passed over
          the spirit of Israel's religion at the time of the
          Exile.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page475">[pg
          475]</span><a name="Pg475" id="Pg475" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of the elements
          that contributed to this change the most important was the deepened
          consciousness of sin that had been produced by the teaching of the
          prophets as verified in the terrible calamity of the Exile. We have
          seen how frequently Ezekiel insists on this effect of the divine
          judgment; how, even in the time of her pardon and restoration, he
          represents Israel as ashamed and confounded, not opening her mouth
          any more for the remembrance of all that she had done. We are
          therefore prepared to find that full provision is made for the
          expression of this abiding sense of guilt in the revised scheme of
          worship. This was done not by new rites invented for the purpose,
          but by seizing on those elements of the old ritual which
          represented the wiping out of iniquity, and by so remodelling the
          whole sacrificial system as to place these prominently in the
          foreground. Such elements were found chiefly in the sin-offering
          and guilt-offering, which occupied a subsidiary position in the old
          Temple, but are elevated to a place of commanding importance in the
          new. The precise distinction between these two kinds of sacrifice
          is an obscure point of the Levitical ritual which has never been
          perfectly cleared up. In the system of Ezekiel, however, we observe
          that the guilt-offering plays no part in the stated service, and
          must therefore have been reserved for private transgressions of the
          law of holiness. And in general it may be remarked that the atoning
          sacrifices differ from others, not in their material, but in
          certain features of the sacred actions to be observed with regard
          to them. We cannot here enter upon the details of the symbolism,
          but the most important fact is that the flesh of the victims is
          neither offered on the altar as in the burnt-offering, nor eaten by
          the worshippers as in the peace-offering, but belongs to the
          category of most holy things, and must be consumed by the priests
          in a holy place. In certain <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page476">[pg 476]</span><a name="Pg476" id="Pg476" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> extreme cases, however, it has to be burned
          without the sanctuary.<a id="noteref_287" name="noteref_287" href=
          "#note_287"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">287</span></span></a></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now in the
          chapters before us the idea of sacrificial atonement is chiefly
          developed in connection with the material fabric of the sanctuary.
          The sanctuary may contract defilement by involuntary lapses from
          the stringent rules of ceremonial purity on the part of those who
          use it, whether priests or laymen. Such errors of inadvertence were
          almost unavoidable under the complicated set of formal regulations
          into which the fundamental idea of holiness branched out, yet they
          are regarded as endangering the sanctity of the Temple, and require
          to be carefully atoned for from time to time, lest by their
          accumulation the worship should be invalidated and Jehovah driven
          from His dwelling-place. But besides this the Temple (or at least
          the altar) is unfit for its sacred functions until it has undergone
          an initial process of purification. The principle involved still
          survives in the consecration of ecclesiastical buildings in
          Christendom, although its application had doubtless a much more
          serious import under the old dispensation than it can possibly have
          under the new.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A full account
          of this initial ceremony of purification is given in the end of the
          forty-third chapter, and a glance at the details of the ritual may
          be enough to impress on us the conceptions that underlie the
          process. It is a protracted operation, extending apparently over
          eight days.<a id="noteref_288" name="noteref_288" href=

          first and fundamental act is the offering of a sin-offering of the
          highest degree of sanctity, the victim being a bullock and the
          flesh being burned <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page477">[pg
          477]</span><a name="Pg477" id="Pg477" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          outside the sanctuary. The blood alone is sprinkled on the four
          horns of the altar, the four corners of the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“settle,”</span> and the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“border”</span>: this is the first stage in the
          dedication of the altar. Then for seven days a he-goat is offered
          for a sin-offering, the same rites being observed, and after it a
          burnt-offering consisting of a bullock and a ram. These sacrifices
          are intended only for the purification of the altar, and only on
          the day after their completion is the altar ready to receive
          ordinary public or private gifts—burnt-offerings and
          peace-offerings. Now four expressions are used to denote the effect
          of these ceremonies on the altar. The most general is <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“consecrate,”</span> literally <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“fill its hand”</span><a id="noteref_289" name=
          "noteref_289" href="#note_289"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">289</span></span></a>—a
          phrase used originally of the installation of a priest into his
          office, and then applied metaphorically to consecration or
          initiation in general. The others are <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“purify,”</span><a id="noteref_290" name="noteref_290"
          href="#note_290"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">290</span></span></a>
          <span class="tei tei-q">“unsin,”</span><a id="noteref_291" name=
          "noteref_291" href="#note_291"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">291</span></span></a> (the
          special effect of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">sin-offering</span></span>) and <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“expiate.”</span><a id="noteref_292" name="noteref_292"
          href="#note_292"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">292</span></span></a> Of
          these the last is the most important. It is the technical priestly
          term for atonement for sin, the reference being of course generally
          to persons. As to the fundamental meaning of the word, there has
          been a great deal of discussion, which has not yet led to a
          decisive result. The choice seems to lie between two radical ideas,
          either to <span class="tei tei-q">“wipe out”</span> or to
          <span class="tei tei-q">“cover,”</span> and so render
          inoperative.<a id="noteref_293" name="noteref_293" href=
          "#note_293"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">293</span></span></a> But
          either etymology enables us to understand the use of the word in
          legal terminology. It means to undo the effect of a transgression
          on the religious status of the offender, or, as in the case before
          us, to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page478">[pg
          478]</span><a name="Pg478" id="Pg478" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          remove natural or contracted impurity from a material object. And
          whether this is conceived as a covering up of the fault so as to
          conceal it from view, or a wiping out of it, amounts in the end to
          the same thing. The significant fact is that the same word is
          applied both to persons and things. It furnishes another
          illustration of the intimate way in which the ideas of moral guilt
          and physical defect are blended in the ceremonial of the Old
          Testament.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The meaning of
          the two atoning services appointed for the beginning of the first
          and the seventh month is now clear. They are intended to renew
          periodically the holiness of the sanctuary established by the
          initiatory rites just described. For it is evident that no
          indelible character can attach to the kind of sanctity with which
          we are here dealing. It is apt to be lost, if not by mere lapse of
          time, at least by the repeated contact of frail men who with the
          best intentions are not always able to fulfil the conditions of a
          right use of sacred things. Every failure and mistake detracts from
          the holiness of the Temple, and even unnoticed and altogether
          unconscious offences would in course of time profane it if not
          purged away. Hence <span class="tei tei-q">“for every one that
          erreth and for him that is simple”</span><a id="noteref_294" name=
          "noteref_294" href="#note_294"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">294</span></span></a>
          atonement has to be made for the house twice a year. The ritual to
          be observed on these occasions bears a general resemblance to that
          of the inaugural ceremony, but is simpler, only a single bullock
          being presented for a sin-offering. On the other hand, it expressly
          symbolises a purification of the Temple as well as of the altar.
          The blood is sprinkled not only on the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“settle”</span> of the altar, but also on the doorposts
          of the house, and the posts of the eastern gate of the inner
          court.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We may now pass
          on to the second application made <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page479">[pg 479]</span><a name="Pg479" id="Pg479" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> by Ezekiel of the idea of sacrificial
          atonement. These purifications of the sanctuary, which bulk so
          largely in his system, have their counterpart in atonements made
          directly for the faults of the people. For this purpose, as we have
          already seen, a sin-offering was to be presented at each of the
          great annual festivals by the prince, for himself and the nation
          which he represented. But it is important to observe that the idea
          of atonement is not confined to one particular class of sacrifices.
          It lies at the foundation of the whole system of the stated
          service, the purpose of which is expressly said to be <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“to make atonement for the house of
          Israel.”</span><a id="noteref_295" name="noteref_295" href=
          "#note_295"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">295</span></span></a> Thus
          while the half-yearly sin-offering afforded a special opportunity
          for confession of sin on the part of the people, we are to
          understand that the holiness of the nation was secured by the
          observance of every part of the prescribed ritual which regulated
          its intercourse with God. And since the nation is in itself
          imperfectly holy and stands in constant need of forgiveness, the
          maintenance of its sanctity by sacrificial rites was equivalent to
          a perpetual act of atonement. Special offences of individuals had
          of course to be expiated by special sacrifices, but beneath all
          particular transgressions lay the broad fact of human impurity and
          infirmity; and in the constant <span class="tei tei-q">“covering
          up”</span> of this by a divinely instituted system of religious
          ordinances we recognise an atoning element in the regular Temple
          service.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sacrificial
          ritual may therefore be regarded as a barrier interposed between
          the natural uncleanness of the people and the awful holiness of
          Jehovah seated in His Temple. That men should be permitted to
          approach Him at all is an unspeakable privilege conferred on Israel
          in virtue of its covenant relation to God. But that the
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page480">[pg 480]</span><a name=
          "Pg480" id="Pg480" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> approach is
          surrounded by so many precautions and restrictions is a perpetual
          witness to the truth that God is of purer eyes than to behold
          iniquity and one with whom evil cannot dwell. If these precautions
          could have been always perfectly observed, it is probable that no
          periodical purification of the sanctuary would have been enjoined.
          The ordinary ritual would have sufficed to maintain the nation in a
          state of holiness corresponding with the requirements of Jehovah's
          nature. But this was impossible on account of the slowness of men's
          minds and their liability to err in their most sacred duties. Sin
          is so subtle and pervasive that it is conceived as penetrating the
          network of ordinances destined to intercept it, and reaching even
          to the dwelling-place of Jehovah Himself. It is to remove such
          accidental, though inevitable, violations of the majesty of God
          that the ritual edifice is crowned by ceremonies for the
          purification of the sanctuary. They are, so to speak, atonements in
          the second degree. Their object is to compensate for defects in the
          ordinary routine of worship, and to remove the arrears of guilt
          which had accumulated through neglect of some part of the
          ceremonial scheme. This idea appears quite clearly in Ezekiel's
          legislation, but it is far more impressively exhibited in the
          Levitical law, where different elements of Ezekiel's ritual are
          gathered up into one celebration in the Great Day of Atonement, the
          most solemn and imposing of the whole year.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hence we see
          that the whole system of sacrificial worship is firmly knit
          together, being pervaded from end to end by the one principle of
          expiation, behind which lay the assurance of pardon and acceptance
          to all who approached God in the use of the appointed means of
          grace. Herein lay the chief value of the Temple ritual for the
          religious life of Israel. It served to impress on the mind of the
          people the great realities of sin and <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page481">[pg 481]</span><a name="Pg481" id="Pg481" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> forgiveness, and so to create that profound
          consciousness of sin which has passed over, spiritualised but not
          weakened, into Christian experience. Thus the law proved itself a
          schoolmaster to bring men to Christ, in whose atoning death the
          evil of sin and the eternal conditions of forgiveness are once for
          all and perfectly revealed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The positive
          truths taught or suggested by the ritual of atonement are too
          numerous to be considered here. It is a remarkable fact that
          neither in Ezekiel nor in any other part of the Old Testament is an
          authoritative interpretation given of the most essential features
          of the ritual. The people seem to have been left to explain the
          symbolism as best they could, and many points which are obscure and
          uncertain to us must have been perfectly intelligible to the least
          instructed amongst them. For us the only safe rule is to follow the
          guidance of the New Testament writers in their use of sacrificial
          institutions as types of the death of Christ. The investigation is
          too large and intricate to be attempted in this place. But it may
          be well in conclusion to point out one or two general principles,
          which ought never to be overlooked in the typical interpretation of
          the expiatory sacrifices of the Old Testament.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the first
          place atonement is provided only for sins committed in ignorance;
          and moral and ceremonial offences stand precisely on the same
          footing in the eye of the law. In Ezekiel's system, indeed, it was
          only sins of inadvertence that needed to be considered. He has in
          view the final state of things in which the people, though not
          perfect nor exempt from liability to error, are wholly inclined to
          obey the law of Jehovah so far as their knowledge and ability
          extend. But even in the Levitical legislation there is no legal
          dispensation for guilt incurred through wanton and deliberate
          defiance of the law of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page482">[pg
          482]</span><a name="Pg482" id="Pg482" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          Jehovah. To sin thus is to sin <span class="tei tei-q">“with a high
          hand,”</span><a id="noteref_296" name="noteref_296" href=
          "#note_296"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">296</span></span></a> and
          such offences have to be expiated by the death of the sinner, or at
          least his exclusion from the religious community. And whether the
          precept belong to what we call the ceremonial or to the moral side
          of the law, the same principle holds good, although of course its
          application is one-sided, strictly moral transgressions being for
          the most part voluntary, while ritual offences may be either
          voluntary or inadvertent. But for wilful and high-handed departure
          from any precept, whether ethical or ceremonial, no atonement is
          provided by the law; the guilty person <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“falls into the hands of the living God,”</span> and
          forgiveness is possible only in the sphere of personal relations
          between man and God, into which the law does not enter.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This leads to a
          second consideration. Atoning sacrifices do not purchase
          forgiveness. That is to say, they are never regarded as exercising
          any influence on God, moving Him to mercy towards the sinner. They
          are simply the forms to which, by Jehovah's own appointment, the
          promise of forgiveness is attached. Hence sacrifice has not the
          fundamental significance in Old Testament religion that the death
          of Christ has in the New. The whole sacrificial system, as we see
          quite clearly from Ezekiel's prophecy, presupposes redemption; the
          people are already restored to their land and sanctified by
          Jehovah's presence amongst them before these institutions come into
          operation. The only purpose that they serve in the system of
          religion to which they belong is to secure that the blessings of
          salvation shall not be lost. Both in this vision and throughout the
          Old Testament the ultimate ground of confidence in God lies in
          historic <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page483">[pg
          483]</span><a name="Pg483" id="Pg483" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          acts of redemption in which Jehovah's sovereign grace and love to
          Israel are revealed. Through the sacrifices the individual was
          enabled to assure himself of his interest in the covenant blessings
          promised to his nation. They were the sacraments of his personal
          acceptance with Jehovah, and as such were of the highest importance
          for his normal religious life. But they were not and could not be
          the basis of the forgiveness of sins, nor did later Judaism ever
          fall into the error of seeking to appease the Deity by a
          multiplication of sacrificial gifts. When the insufficiency of the
          ritual system to give true peace of conscience or to bring back the
          outward tokens of God's favour is dwelt upon, the ancient Church
          falls back on the spiritual conditions of forgiveness already
          enunciated by the prophets.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Finally, we have
          learned from Ezekiel that the idea of atonement is not lodged in
          any particular rite, but pervades the sacrificial system as a
          whole. Suggestive as the ritual of the sin-offering is to the
          Christian conscience, it must not be isolated from other
          developments of the sacrificial idea or taken to embody the whole
          permanent meaning of the institution. There are at least two other
          aspects of sacrifice which are clearly expressed in the ritual
          legislation of the Old Testament—that of homage, chiefly symbolised
          by the burnt-offering, and that of communion, symbolised by the
          peace-offering and the sacrificial feast observed in connection
          with it. And although, both in Ezekiel and the Levitical law, these
          two elements are thrown into the shade by the idea of expiation,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page484">[pg 484]</span><a name=
          "Pg484" id="Pg484" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> yet there are subtle
          links of affinity between all three, which will have to be traced
          out before we are in a position to understand the first principles
          of sacrificial worship. The brilliant and learned researches of the
          late Professor Robertson Smith have thrown a flood of light on the
          original rite of sacrifice and the important place which it
          occupies in ancient religion.<a id="noteref_298" name="noteref_298"
          href="#note_298"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">298</span></span></a> He
          has sought to explain the intricate system of the Levitical
          legislation as an unfolding, under varied historical influences, of
          different aspects of the idea of communion between God and men,
          which is the essence of primitive sacrifice. In particular he has
          shown how special atoning sacrifices arise through emphasising by
          appropriate symbolism the element of reconciliation which is
          implicitly contained in every act of religious communion with God.
          This at least enables us to understand how the atoning ritual with
          all its distinctive features yet resembles so closely that which is
          common to all types of sacrifice, and how the idea of expiation,
          although concentrated in a particular class of sacrifices, is
          nevertheless spread over the whole surface of the sacrificial
          ritual. It would be premature as well as presumptuous to attempt
          here to estimate the consequences of this theory for Christian
          theology. But it certainly seems to open up the prospect of a wider
          and deeper apprehension of the religious truths which are
          differentiated and specialised in the Old Testament dispensation,
          to be reunited in that great Atoning Sacrifice, in which the blood
          of the new covenant has been shed for many for the remission of
          sins.</p>

          part of the forty-seventh chapter the visionary form of the
          revelation, which had been interrupted by the important series of
          communications on which we have been so long engaged, is again
          resumed. The prophet, once more under the direction of his angelic
          guide, sees a stream of water issuing from the Temple buildings and
          flowing eastward into the Dead Sea.<a id="noteref_299" name=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Temple
            stream, to which Ezekiel's attention is now for the first time
            directed, is a symbol of the miraculous transformation which the
            land of Canaan is to undergo in order to fit it for the
            habitation of Jehovah's ransomed people. Anticipations of a
            renewal of the face of nature are a common feature of Messianic
            prophecy. They have their roots in the religious interpretation
            of the possession of the land as the chief token of the divine
            blessing on the nation. In the vicissitudes of agricultural or
            pastoral life the Israelite read the reflection of Jehovah's
            attitude <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page486">[pg
            486]</span><a name="Pg486" id="Pg486" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            towards Himself and His people: fertile seasons and luxuriant
            harvests were the sign of His favour; drought and famine were the
            proof that He was offended. Even at the best of times, however,
            the condition of Palestine left much to be desired from the
            husbandman's point of view, especially in the kingdom of Judah.
            Nature was often stern and unpropitious, the cultivation of the
            soil was always attended with hardship and uncertainty, large
            tracts of the country were given over to irreclaimable
            barrenness. There was always a vision of better things possible,
            and in the last days the prophets cherished the expectation that
            that vision would be realised. When all causes of offence are
            removed from Israel and Jehovah smiles on His people, the land
            will blossom into supernatural fertility, the ploughman
            overtaking the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that soweth
            seed, the mountains dropping new wine and the hills
            melting.<a id="noteref_301" name="noteref_301" href=

            Such idyllic pictures of universal plenty and comfort abound in
            the writings of the prophets, and are not wanting in the pages of
            Ezekiel. We have already had one in the description of the
            blessings of the Messianic kingdom;<a id="noteref_302" name=
            "noteref_302" href="#note_302"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">302</span></span></a> and
            we shall see that in this closing vision a complete remodelling
            of the land is presupposed, rendering it all alike suitable for
            the habitation of the tribes of Israel.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The river of
            life is the most striking presentation of this general conception
            of Messianic felicity. It is one of those vivid images from
            Eastern life which, through the Apocalypse, have passed into the
            symbolism of Christian eschatology. <span class="tei tei-q">“And
            he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal,
            proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb. In the midst
            of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there
            the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded
            her fruits every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page487">[pg 487]</span><a name=
            "Pg487" id="Pg487" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> healing of the
            nations.”</span><a id="noteref_303" name="noteref_303" href=
            "#note_303"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">303</span></span></a> So
            writes the seer of Patmos, in words whose music charms the ear
            even of those to whom running water means much less than it did
            to a native of thirsty Palestine. But John had read of the mystic
            river in the pages of his favourite prophet before he saw it in
            vision. The close resemblance between the two pictures leaves no
            doubt that the origin of the conception is to be sought in
            Ezekiel's vision. The underlying religious truth is the same in
            both representations, that the presence of God is the source from
            which the influences flow forth that renew and purify human
            existence. The tree of life on each bank of the river, which
            yields its fruit every month and whose leaves are for healing, is
            a detail transferred directly from Ezekiel's imagery to fill out
            the description of the glorious city of God into which the
            nations of them that are saved are gathered.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But with all
            its idealism, Ezekiel's conception presents many points of
            contact with the actual physiography of Palestine; it is less
            universal and abstract in its significance than that of the
            Apocalypse. The first thing that might have suggested the idea to
            the prophet is that the Temple mount had at least one small
            stream, whose <span class="tei tei-q">“soft-flowing”</span>
            waters were already regarded as a symbol of the silent and
            unobtrusive influence of the divine presence in Israel.<a id=
            "noteref_304" name="noteref_304" href="#note_304"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">304</span></span></a> The
            waters of this stream flowed eastward, but they were too scanty
            to have any appreciable effect on the fertility of the region
            through which they passed. Further, to the south-east of
            Jerusalem, between it and the Dead Sea, stretched the great
            wilderness of Judah, the most desolate and inhospitable tract in
            the whole country. There the steep declivity of the limestone
            range refuses to detain sufficient moisture to nourish the most
            meagre vegetation, although the few spots where wells are found,
            as at Engedi, are clothed with almost tropical luxuriance.
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page488">[pg 488]</span><a name=
            "Pg488" id="Pg488" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> To reclaim these
            barren slopes and render them fit for human industry, the Temple
            waters are sent eastward, making the desert to blossom as the
            rose. Lastly, there was the Dead Sea itself, in whose bitter
            waters no living thing can exist, the natural emblem of
            resistance to the purposes of Him who is the God of life. These
            different elements of the physical reality were familiar to
            Ezekiel, and come back to mind as he follows the course of the
            new Temple river, and observes the wonderful transformation which
            it is destined to effect. He first sees it breaking forth from
            the wall of the Temple at the right-hand side of the entrance,
            and flowing eastward through the courts by the south side of the
            altar. Then at the outer wall he meets it rushing from the south
            side of the eastern gate, and still pursuing its easterly course.
            At a thousand cubits from the sanctuary it is only ankle deep,
            but at successive distances of a thousand cubits it reaches to
            the knees, to the loins, and becomes finally an impassable river.
            The stream is of course miraculous from source to mouth. Earthly
            rivers do not thus broaden and deepen as they flow, except by the
            accession of tributaries, and tributaries are out of the question
            here. Thus it flows on, with its swelling volume of water,
            through <span class="tei tei-q">“the eastern circuit,”</span>
            <span class="tei tei-q">“down to the Arabah”</span> (the trough
            of the Jordan and the Dead Sea), and reaching the sea it sweetens
            its waters so that they teem with fishes of all kinds like those
            of the Mediterranean. Its uninviting shores become the scene of a
            busy and thriving industry; fishermen ply their craft from Engedi
            to Eneglaim,<a id="noteref_305" name="noteref_305" href=
            "#note_305"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">305</span></span></a> and
            the food supply of the country is materially increased. The
            prophet may not have been greatly concerned about this, but one
            characteristic detail illustrates <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page489">[pg 489]</span><a name="Pg489" id="Pg489" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> his careful forethought in matters of
            practical utility. It is from the Dead Sea that Jerusalem has
            always obtained its supply of salt. The purification of this lake
            might have its drawbacks if the production of this indispensable
            commodity should be interfered with. Salt, besides its culinary
            uses, played an important part in the Temple ritual, and Ezekiel
            was not likely to forget it. Hence the strange but eminently
            practical provision that the shallows and marshes at the south
            end of the lake shall be exempted from the influence of the
            healing waters. <span class="tei tei-q">“They are given for
            salt.”</span><a id="noteref_306" name="noteref_306" href=
            "#note_306"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">306</span></span></a></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We may venture
            to draw one lesson for our own instruction from this beautiful
            prophetic image of the blessings that flow from a pure religion.
            The river of God has its source high up in the mount where
            Jehovah dwells in inaccessible holiness, and where the
            white-robed priests minister ceaselessly before Him; but in its
            descent it seeks out the most desolate and unpromising region in
            the country, and turns it into a garden of the Lord. While the
            whole land of Israel is to be renewed and made to minister to the
            good of man in fellowship with God, the main stream of fertility
            is expended in the apparently hopeless task of reclaiming the
            Judæan desert and purifying the Dead Sea. It is an emblem of the
            earthly ministry of Him who made Himself the friend of publicans
            and sinners, and lavished the resources of His grace and the
            wealth of His affection on those who were deemed beyond ordinary
            possibility of salvation. It is to be feared, however, that the
            practice of most Churches has been too much the reverse of this.
            They have been tempted to confine the water of life within fairly
            respectable channels, amongst the prosperous and contented, the
            occupants of happy homes, where the advantages of <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page490">[pg 490]</span><a name="Pg490" id=
            "Pg490" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> religion are most likely to
            be appreciated. That seems to have been found the line of least
            resistance, and in times when spiritual life has run low it has
            been counted enough to keep the old ruts filled and leave the
            waste places and stagnant waters of our civilisation ill provided
            with the means of grace. Nowadays we are sometimes reminded that
            the Dead Sea must be drained before the gospel can have a fair
            chance of influencing human lives, and there may be much wisdom
            in the suggestion. A vast deal of social drainage may have to be
            accomplished before the word of God has free course. Unhealthy
            and impure conditions of life may be mitigated by wise
            legislation, temptations to vice may be removed, and vested
            interests that thrive on the degradation of human lives may be
            crushed by the strong arm of the community. But the true spirit
            of Christianity can neither be confined to the watercourses of
            religious habit, nor wait for the schemes of the social reformer.
            Nor will it display its powers of social salvation until it
            carries the energies of the Church into the lowest haunts of vice
            and misery with an earnest desire to seek and to save that which
            is lost. Ezekiel had his vision, and he believed in it. He
            believed in the reality of God's presence in the sanctuary and in
            the stream of blessings that flowed from His throne, and he
            believed in the possibility of reclaiming the waste places of his
            country for the kingdom of God. When Christians are united in
            like faith in the power of Christ and the abiding presence of His
            Spirit, we may expect to see times of refreshing from the
            presence of God and the whole earth filled with the knowledge of
            the Lord as the waters cover the sea.</p>

            of Palestine is marked by something of the same mathematical
            regularity which was exhibited in <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

            like those we sometimes see on the map of a newly settled country
            like America or Australia—that is to say, they largely follow the
            meridian lines and parallels of latitude, but take advantage here
            and there of natural frontiers supplied by rivers and mountain
            ranges. This is absolutely true of the internal divisions of the
            land between the tribes. Here the northern and southern
            boundaries are straight lines running east and west over hill and
            dale, and terminating at the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan
            Valley, which form of course the western and eastern limits. As
            to the external delimitation of the country it is unfortunately
            not possible to speak with certainty. The eastern frontier is
            fixed by the Jordan and the Dead Sea so far as they go, and the
            western is the sea. But on the north and south the lines of
            demarcation cannot be traced, the places mentioned being nearly
            all unknown. The north frontier extends from the sea to a place
            called Hazar-enon, said to lie on the border of Hauran. It passes
            the <span class="tei tei-q">“entrance to Hamath,”</span> and has
            to the north not only Hamath, but also the territory of Damascus.
            But none of the towns through which it passes—Hethlon, Berotha,
            Sibraim—can be identified, and even its general direction is
            altogether uncertain.<a id="noteref_307" name="noteref_307" href=

            and is prolonged south of the Dead Sea to a place called Tamar,
            also unknown. From this we proceed westwards by Kadesh till we
            strike the river of Egypt, the Wady el-Arish, which carries the
            boundary to the sea. It will be seen that Ezekiel, for reasons on
            which it is idle to speculate, excludes the transjordanic
            territory from the Holy Land. Speaking broadly, we may say that
            he treats Palestine as a rectangular strip of country, which he
            divides into transverse sections of indeterminate breadth, and
            then proceeds to parcel out these amongst the twelve tribes.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A similar
            obscurity rests on the motives which determined the disposition
            of the different tribes within the sacred territory. We can
            understand, indeed, why seven tribes are placed to the north and
            only five to the south of the capital and the sanctuary.
            Jerusalem lay much nearer the south of the land, and in the
            original distribution all the tribes had their settlements to the
            north of it except Judah and Simeon. Ezekiel's arrangement seems
            thus to combine a desire for symmetry with a recognition of the
            claims of historical and geographic reality. We can also see that
            to a certain extent the relative positions of the tribes
            correspond with those they held before the Exile, although of
            course the system requires that they shall lie in a regular
            series from north to south. Dan, Asher, and Naphtali are left in
            the extreme north, Manasseh and Ephraim to the south of them,
            while Simeon lies as of old in the south with one tribe between
            it and the capital. But we cannot tell why Benjamin should be
            placed to the south and Judah to the north of Jerusalem, why
            Issachar and Zebulun are transferred from the far north to the
            south, or why Reuben and Gad are taken from the east of the
            Jordan to be settled one to the north and the other to the south
            of the city. Some principle of arrangement there must have been
            in the mind of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page493">[pg
            493]</span><a name="Pg493" id="Pg493" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            prophet, and several have been suggested; but it is perhaps
            better to confess that we have lost the key to his meaning.<a id=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The prophet's
            interest is centred on the strip of land reserved for the
            sanctuary and public purposes, which is subdivided and measured
            out with the utmost precision. It is twenty-five thousand cubits
            (about 8-1/3 miles) broad, and extends right across the country.
            The two extremities east and west are the crown lands assigned to
            the prince for the purposes we have already seen. In the middle a
            square of twenty-five thousand cubits is marked off; this is the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“oblation”</span> or sacred offering of
            land, in the middle of which the Temple stands. This again is
            subdivided into three parallel sections, as shown in the
            accompanying diagram. The most northerly, ten thousand cubits in
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page494">[pg 494]</span><a name=
            "Pg494" id="Pg494" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> breadth, is
            assigned to the Levites; the central portion, including the
            sanctuary, to the priests; and the remaining five thousand cubits
            is a <span class="tei tei-q">“profane place”</span> for the city
            and its common lands. The city itself is a square of four
            thousand five hundred cubits, situated in the middle of this
            southmost section of the oblation. With its free space of two
            hundred and fifty cubits in width belting the wall it fills the
            entire breadth of the section; the communal possessions flanking
            it on either hand, just as the prince's domain does the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“oblation”</span> as a whole. The produce
            of these lands is <span class="tei tei-q">“for food to them that
            <span class="tei tei-q">‘serve’</span> [<span class=

            Residence in the capital, it appears, is to be regarded as a
            public service. The maintenance of the civic life of Jerusalem
            was an object in which the whole nation was interested, a truth
            symbolised by naming its twelve gates after the twelve sons of
            Jacob.<a id="noteref_310" name="noteref_310" href=
            "#note_310"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">310</span></span></a>
            Hence, also, its population is to be representative of all the
            tribes of Israel, and whoever comes to dwell there is to have a
            share in the land belonging to the city.<a id="noteref_311" name=
            "noteref_311" href="#note_311"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">311</span></span></a> But
            evidently the legislation on this point is incomplete. How were
            the inhabitants of the capital to be chosen out of all the
            tribes? Would its citizenship be regarded as a privilege or as an
            onerous responsibility? Would it be necessary to make a selection
            out of a host of applications, or would special inducements have
            to be offered to procure a sufficient population? To these
            questions the vision furnishes no answer, and there is nothing to
            show whether Ezekiel contemplated the possibility that residence
            in the new city might present few attractions and many
            disadvantages <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page495">[pg
            495]</span><a name="Pg495" id="Pg495" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            to an agricultural community such as he had in view. It is a
            curious incident of the return from the Exile that the problem of
            peopling Jerusalem emerged in a more serious form than Ezekiel
            from his ideal point of view could have foreseen. We read that
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the rulers of the people dwelt at
            Jerusalem: the rest of the people also cast lots, to bring one of
            ten to dwell in Jerusalem, the holy city, and nine parts in
            [other] cities. And the people blessed all the men that willingly
            offered themselves to dwell at Jerusalem.”</span><a id=
            "noteref_312" name="noteref_312" href="#note_312"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">312</span></span></a>
            There may have been causes for this general reluctance which are
            unknown to us, but the principal reason was doubtless the one
            which has been hinted at, that the new colony lived mainly by
            agriculture, and the district in the immediate vicinity of the
            capital was not sufficiently fertile to support a large
            agricultural population. The new Jerusalem was at first a
            somewhat artificial foundation, and a city too largely developed
            for the resources of the community of which it was the centre.
            Its existence was necessary more for the protection and support
            of the Temple than for the ordinary ends of civilisation; and
            hence to dwell in it was for the majority an act of
            self-sacrifice by which a man was felt to deserve well of his
            country. And the only important difference between the actual
            reality and Ezekiel's ideal is that in the latter the
            supernatural fertility of the land and the reign of universal
            peace obviate the difficulties which the founders of the
            post-exilic theocracy had to encounter.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This seeming
            indifference of the prophet to the secular interests represented
            by the metropolis strikes us as a singular feature in his
            programme. It is strange that the man who was so thoughtful about
            the salt-pans of the Dead Sea should pass so lightly over the
            details of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page496">[pg
            496]</span><a name="Pg496" id="Pg496" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            the reconstruction of a city. But we have had several intimations
            that this is not the department of things in which Ezekiel's hold
            on reality is most conspicuous. We have already remarked on the
            boldness of the conception which changes the site of the capital
            in order to guard the sanctity of the Temple. And now, when its
            situation and form are accurately defined, we have no sketch of
            municipal institutions, no hint of the purposes for which the
            city exists, and no glimpse of the busy and varied activities
            which we naturally connect with the name. If Ezekiel thought of
            it at all, except as existing on paper, he was probably
            interested in it as furnishing the representative congregation on
            minor occasions of public worship, such as the Sabbaths and new
            moons, when the whole people could not be expected to assemble.
            The truth is that the idea of the city in the vision is simply an
            abstract religious symbol, a sort of epitome and concentration of
            theocratic life. Like the figure of the prince in earlier
            chapters, it is taken from the national institutions which
            perished at the Exile; the outline is retained, the typical
            significance is enhanced, but the form is shadowy and indistinct,
            the colour and variety of concrete reality are absent. It was
            perhaps a stage through which political conceptions had to pass
            before their religious meaning could be apprehended. And yet the
            fact that the symbol of the Holy City is preserved is deeply
            suggestive and indeed scarcely less important in its own way than
            the retention of the type of the king. Ezekiel can no more think
            of the land without a capital than of the state without a prince.
            The word <span class="tei tei-q">“city”</span>—synonym of the
            fullest and most intense form of life, of life regulated by law
            and elevated by devotion to a common ideal, in which every worthy
            faculty of human nature is quickened by the close and varied
            intercourse of men with each other—has definitely taken its place
            in the vocabulary of religion. <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page497">[pg 497]</span><a name="Pg497" id="Pg497" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> It is there, not to be superseded, but to
            be refined and spiritualised, until the city of God, glorified in
            the praises of Israel, becomes the inspiration of the loftiest
            thought and the most ardent longing of Christendom. And even for
            the perplexing problems that the Church has to face at this day
            there is hardly a more profitable exercise of the Christian
            imagination than to dream with practical intent of the
            consecration of civic life through the subjection of all its
            influences to the ends of the Redeemer's kingdom.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the other
            hand we must surely recognise that this vision of a Temple and a
            city separated from each other—where religious and secular
            interests are as it were concentrated at different points, so
            that the one may be more effectually subordinated to the other—is
            not the final and perfect vision of the kingdom of God. That
            ideal has played a leading and influential part in the history of
            Christianity. It is essentially the ideal formulated in
            Augustine's great work on the city of God, which ruled the
            ecclesiastical polity of the mediæval Church. The State is an
            unholy institution; it is an embodiment of the power of this
            present evil world: the true city of God is the visible Catholic
            Church, and only by subjection to the Church can the State be
            redeemed from itself and be made a means of blessing. That theory
            served a providential purpose in preserving the traditions of
            Christianity through dark and troubled ages, and training the
            rude nations of Europe in purity and righteousness and reverence
            for that by which God makes Himself known. But the Reformation
            was, amongst other things, a protest against this conception of
            the relation of Church to State, of the sacred to the secular. By
            asserting the right of each believer to deal with Christ directly
            without the mediation of Church or priest it broke down the
            middle wall of partition between religion and every-day duty; it
            sanctified common <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page498">[pg
            498]</span><a name="Pg498" id="Pg498" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            life by showing how a man may serve God as a citizen in the
            family or the workshop better than in the cloister or at the
            altar. It made the kingdom of God to be a present power wherever
            there are lives transformed by love to Christ and serving their
            fellow-men for His sake. And if Catholicism may find some
            plausible support for its theory in Ezekiel and the Old Testament
            theocracy in general, Protestants may perhaps with better right
            appeal to the grander ideal represented by the new Jerusalem of
            the Apocalypse—the city that needs no Temple, because the Lord
            Himself is in her midst.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
            "tei tei-q">“And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming
            down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her
            husband. And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold,
            the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them,
            and they shall be His people, and God Himself shall be with them,
            and be their God.... And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord
            God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it. And the city had
            no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the
            glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light
            thereof.”</span><a id="noteref_313" name="noteref_313" href=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It may be
            difficult for us amid the entanglements of the present to read
            that vision aright—difficult to say whether it is on earth or in
            heaven that we are to look for the city in which there is no
            Temple. Worship is an essential function of the Church of Christ;
            and so long as we are in our earthly abode worship will require
            external symbols and a visible organisation. But this at least we
            know, that the will of God must be done on earth as it is in
            heaven. The true kingdom of God is within us; and His presence
            with men is realised, not in special religious services which
            stand apart from our common life, but in <span class="tei tei-pb"

            forming our characters after the image of Christ, and permeating
            all the channels of social intercourse and public action, until
            everything done on earth is to the glory of our Father which is
            in heaven. That is the ideal set forth by the coming of the holy
            city of God, and only in this way can we look for the fulfilment
            of the promise embodied in the new name of Ezekiel's city,

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">These verses (ch. iii. 22-27) furnish
          one of the chief supports of Klostermann's peculiar theory of
          Ezekiel's condition during the first period of his career. Taking
          the word <span class="tei tei-q">“dumb”</span> in its literal
          sense, he considers that the prophet was afflicted with the malady
          known as <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">alalia</span></span>, that this was
          intermittent down to the date of ch. xxiv., and then became chronic
          till the fugitive arrived from Jerusalem (ch. xxxiii. 21), when it
          finally disappeared. This is connected with the remarkable series
          of symbolic actions related in ch. iv., which are regarded as
          exhibiting all the symptoms of catalepsy and hemiplegia. These
          facts, together with the prophet's liability to ecstatic visions,
          justify, in Klostermann's view, the hypothesis that for seven years
          Ezekiel laboured under serious nervous disorders. The partiality
          shown by a few writers to this view probably springs from a desire
          to maintain the literal accuracy of the prophet's descriptions. But
          in that aspect the theory breaks down. Even Klostermann admits that
          the binding with ropes had no existence save in Ezekiel's
          imagination. But if we are obliged to take into account what
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">seemed</span></em> to the prophet, it is
          better to explain the whole phenomena on the same principle. There
          can be no good grounds for taking the dumbness as real and the
          ropes as imaginary. Besides, it is surely a questionable expedient
          to vindicate a prophet's literalism at the expense of his sanity.
          In the hands of Klostermann and Orelli the hypothesis assumes a
          stupendous miracle; but it is obvious that a critic of another
          school might readily <span class="tei tei-q">“wear his rue with a
          difference,”</span> and treat the whole of Ezekiel's prophetic
          experiences as hallucinations of a deranged intellect.</dd>

          the application of the doctrine of individual retribution to the
          destruction of Jerusalem is discussed. It is treated as
          <span class="tei tei-q">“an exception to the rule”</span>
          (Smend)—perhaps the exception which proves the rule. The rule is
          that in a national judgment the most eminent saints save neither
          son nor daughter by their righteousness, but only their own lives
          (vv. 13-20). At the fall of Jerusalem, however, a remnant escapes
          and goes into captivity with sons and daughters, in order that
          their corrupt lives may prove to the earlier exiles how necessary
          the destruction of the city was (vv. 21-23). The argument is an
          admission that the judgment on Israel was not carried out in
          accordance with the strict principle laid down in ch. xviii. It is
          difficult, indeed, to reconcile the various utterances of Ezekiel
          on this subject. In ch. xxi. 3, 4 he expressly announces that in
          the downfall of the state righteous and wicked shall perish
          together. In the vision of ch. ix., on the other hand, the
          righteous are marked for exemption from the fate of the city. The
          truth appears to be that the prophet is conscious of standing
          between two dispensations, and does not hold a consistent view
          regarding the time when the law proper to the perfect dispensation
          comes into operation. The point on which there is no ambiguity is
          that in the final judgment which ushers in the Messianic age the
          principle of individual retribution shall be fully manifested.</dd>

          introducing a new division of the book, or whether (as seems more
          natural) it is due to the fact that here Ezekiel recognised a
          turning-point of his ministry. Such visits of the elders as that
          here recorded must have been of frequent occurrence. Two others are
          mentioned, and of these one is undated (ch. xiv. 1); the other at
          least admits the supposition that it was connected with a very

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There still
            remain the critical difficulties. What are the ambiguous laws to
            which the prophet refers? It is of course not to be assumed as
            certain that they are to be found in the Pentateuch, at least in
            the exact form which Ezekiel has in view. There may have been at
            that time a considerable amount of uncodified legislative
            material which passed vaguely as the law of Jehovah. The
            <span class="tei tei-q">“lying pen of the scribes”</span> seems
            to have been busy in the multiplication of such enactments (Jer.
            viii. 8). Still, it is a legitimate inquiry whether any of the
            extant laws of the Pentateuch are open to the interpretation
            which Ezekiel seems to have in view. The parts of the Pentateuch
            in which the regulation about the dedication of the firstborn
            occurs are the so-called Book of the Covenant (Exod. xxii. 29,
            30), the short code of Exod. xxxiv. 17-26 (vv. 19 f.), the
            enactment connected with the institution of the Passover (Exod.
            xiii. 12 f.), and the priestly ordinance (Numb. xviii. 15). Now,
            in three of these four passages, the inference to which Ezekiel
            refers is expressly excluded by the provision that the firstborn
            of men shall be redeemed. The only one which bears the appearance
            of ambiguity is that in the Book of the Covenant, where we read:
            <span class="tei tei-q">“The firstborn of thy sons shalt thou
            give unto Me; likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen and thy
            sheep: seven days it shall be with its dam, on the eighth day
            thou shalt give it to Me.”</span> Here the firstborn children and
            the firstlings of animals are put on a level; and if any passage
            in our present Pentateuch would lend itself to the false
            construction which the later Israelites favoured, it would be
            this. On the other hand this passage does not contain the
            particular technical word (<span lang="he" class=
            "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="he"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">he'ebîr</span></span>) used by Ezekiel. The
            word probably means simply <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“dedicate,”</span> although this was understood in
            the sense of dedication by sacrifice. The only passage of the
            four where the verb occurs is Exod. xiii. 12; and this
            accordingly is the one generally fixed on by critics as having
            sanctioned the abuse in question. But apart from its express
            exemption of firstborn children from the rule, the passage fails
            in another respect to meet the requirements of the case. The
            prophet appears to speak here of legislation addressed to the
            second generation in the wilderness, and this could not refer to
            the Passover ordinance in its present setting. On the whole we
            seem to be driven to the conclusion that Ezekiel is not thinking
            of any part of our present Pentateuch, but to some other law
            similar in its terms to that of Exod. xiii. 12 f., although
            equivocal in the same way as Exod. xxii. 29 f.</p>

            interpretation of the passage, without referring to the numerous

            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Le

            conclusion that the <span class="tei tei-q">“statutes which were
            not good”</span> are not statutes at all, but providential
            chastisements. That cuts the knot, it does not untie it.</p>

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">The transition ver. 39 is, however,
          very difficult. As it stands in the Hebrew text it contains an
          ironical concession (a good-natured one, Smend thinks) to the
          persistent advocates of idolatry, the only tolerable translation
          being, <span class="tei tei-q">“So serve ye every man his idols,
          but hereafter ye shall surely hearken to Me, and My holy name ye
          shall no longer profane with your gifts and your idols.”</span> But
          this sense is not in itself very natural, and the Hebrew
          construction by which it is expressed would be somewhat strained.
          The most satisfactory rendering is perhaps that given in the Syriac
          Version, where two clauses of our Hebrew text are transposed:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“But as for you, O house of Israel, if ye
          will not hearken to Me, go serve every man his idols! Yet hereafter
          ye shall no more profane My holy name in you,”</span> etc.</dd>

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">It is not certain what is the exact
          meaning wrapped up in these designations. A very slight change in
          the pointing of the Hebrew would give the sense <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">her</span></em> tent”</span> for Ohola and
          <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">my</span></em> tent in her”</span> for
          Oholibah. This is the interpretation adopted by most commentators,
          the idea being that while the tent or temple of Jehovah was in
          Judah, Samaria's <span class="tei tei-q">“tent”</span> (religious
          system) was of her own making. It is not likely, however, that
          Ezekiel has any such sharp contrast in his mind, since the whole of
          the argument proceeds on the similarity of the course pursued by
          the two kingdoms. It is simpler to take the word Ohola as meaning
          <span class="tei tei-q">“tent,”</span> and Oholibah as <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“tent in her,”</span> the signification of the names
          being practically identical. The allusion is supposed to be to the
          tents of the high places which formed a marked feature of the
          idolatrous worship practised in both divisions of the country (cf.
          ch. xvi. 16). This is better, though not entirely convincing, since
          it does not explain how Ezekiel came to fix on this particular
          emblem as a mark of the religious condition of Israel. It may be
          worth noting that the word אהלה contains the same number of
          consonants as שׂמרן (= Samaria, although the word is always written
          שׂמרון in the Old Testament), and אהליבה the same number as ירושלם.
          The Eastern custom of giving similar names to children of the same
          family (like Hasan and Husein) is aptly instanced by Smend and

          so incomplete a sketch as this, that there is still some difference
          of opinion among critics as to Ezekiel's relation to the so-called
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Law of Holiness”</span> in Lev.
          xvii.-xxvi. It is agreed that this short but extremely interesting
          code is the earliest complete, or nearly complete, document that
          has been incorporated in the body of the Levitical legislation. Its
          affinities with Ezekiel both in thought and style are so striking
          that Colenso and others have maintained the theory that the author
          of the Law of Holiness was no other than the prophet himself. This
          view is now seen to be untenable; but whether the code is older or
          more recent than the vision of Ezekiel is still a subject of
          discussion among scholars. Some consider that it is an advance upon
          Ezekiel in the direction of the Priests' Code; while others think
          that the book of Ezekiel furnishes evidence that the prophet was
          acquainted with the Law of Holiness, and had it before him as he
          wrote. That he was acquainted with its <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">laws</span></em>
          seems certain; the question is whether he had them before him in

            to take the half of Ezekiel's dimensions to get the measurement
            in English yards. The other, however, is more probable. Both the
            Egyptians and Babylonians had a larger and a smaller cubit, their

          idealism of Ezekiel's vision. The miraculous transformation of the
          land had not taken place, and it was altogether impossible to build
          a new metropolis in the region marked out for it by the vision. The
          Temple had to be erected on its old site, and in the immediate
          neighbourhood of the city. To a certain extent, however, the
          requirements of the ideal sanctuary could be complied with. Since
          the new community had no use for royal buildings, the whole of the
          old Temple plateau was available for the sanctuary, and was
          actually devoted to this purpose. The new Temple accordingly had
          two courts, set apart for sacred uses; and in all probability these
          were laid out in a manner closely corresponding to the plan
          prepared by Ezekiel.</dd>

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">It is not necessary to dwell on the
          third feature of the Temple plan, its symmetry. Although this has
          not the same direct religious significance as the other two, it is
          nevertheless a point to which considerable importance is attached
          even in matters of minute detail. Solomon's Temple had, for
          example, only one door to the side chambers, in the wall facing the
          south, and this was sufficient for all practical purposes. But
          Ezekiel's plan provides for two such doors, one in the south and
          the other in the north, for no assignable reason but to make the
          two sides of the house exactly alike. There are just two slight
          deviations from a strictly symmetrical arrangement that can be
          discerned; one is the washing-chamber by the side of one of the
          gates of the inner court, and the other the space for cooking the
          most holy class of sacrifices near the block of cells on the north
          side of the Temple. With these insignificant exceptions, all the
          parts of the sanctuary are disposed with mathematical regularity;
          nothing is left to chance, regard for convenience is everywhere
          subordinated to the sense of proportion which expresses the ideal
          order and perfection of the whole.</dd>

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">The regulations of the Priests' Code
          with regard to the revenues of the Temple clergy are most
          comprehensively given in Numb. xviii. 8-32. The first thing that
          strikes us there is the distinction between the due of the priests
          and that of the Levites. The absence of any express provision for
          the latter is a somewhat remarkable feature in Ezekiel's
          legislation, when we consider the care with which he has defined
          the status and duties of the order. It is evident, however, that no
          complete arrangements could be made for the Temple service without
          some law on this point such as is contained in the passage Num.
          xviii. and referred to in Neh. x. 37-39; and this is closely
          connected with a disposition of the tithes and firstlings different
          from the directions of Deuteronomy, and probably also from the
          tacit assumption of Ezekiel. The book of Deuteronomy leaves no
          doubt that both the tithes of natural produce and the firstlings of
          the flock and herd were intended to furnish the material for
          sacrificial feasts at the sanctuary (cf. chs. xii. 6, 7, 11, 12,
          xiv. 22-27). The priest received the usual portions of the
          firstlings (ch. xviii. 3), and also a share of the tithe; but the
          rest was eaten by the worshipper and his guests. In Numb. xviii.,
          on the other hand, all the firstlings are the property of the
          priest (ver. 15), and the whole of the tithes is assigned to the
          Levites, who in turn are required to hand over a tenth of the tithe
          to the priests (vv. 24-32). The portion of the priests consists of
          the following items: (1) The meal-offering, sin-offering, and
          guilt-offering (as in Ezekiel); (2) the best of oil, new wine, and
          corn (as in Deuteronomy) (ver. 12); (3) all the firstfruits (an
          advance on Ezekiel) (ver. 13); (4) every devoted thing (Ezekiel)
          (ver. 14); (5) all the firstlings (vv. 15-18); (6) the breast and
          right thigh of all ordinary private sacrifices (ver. 18: cf. Lev.
          vii. 31-34) (like Deuteronomy, but choicer portions); (7) the tenth
          of the Levites' tithe. It will be seen from this enumeration that
          the Temple tariff of the Priestly law includes, with some slight
          modification, all the requirements of Deuteronomy and Ezekiel,
          besides the two important additions referred to above.</dd>

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">It is usual to speak of these
          ceremonies in Ezekiel as festivals. But this seems to go beyond the
          prophet's meaning. Only a single sacrifice, a sin-offering, is
          mentioned; and there is no hint of any public assemblage of the
          people on these days. It was the priests' business to see that the
          sanctuary was purified, and there was no occasion for the people to
          be present at the ceremony. The congregation would be the ordinary
          congregation at the new moon feast, which of course did not
          represent the whole population of the country. No doubt, as we see
          from the references below, the ceremony developed into a special
          feast after the Exile.</dd>

          process within the limits of the week. This certainly looks more
          satisfactory in itself. But would Ezekiel be likely to admit an
          ellipsis in describing so important a function? I have taken for

          monarchy. The statement that the territory of Damascus lies to the
          north presents some difficulty on any theory. It may be added that
          Hazar-hattikon in ver. 16 is the same as Hazar-enon; it is

              and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance
              they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™'s goals
              and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will remain
              freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
              Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a
              secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
              generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project
              Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
              public support and donations to carry out its mission of
              increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that
              can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible
              by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.
              Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important
              to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
              Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
              charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the
              United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it
              takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to
              meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit
              donations in locations where we have not received written
              confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the
              status of compliance for any particular state visit <a href=
              "http://www.gutenberg.org/donate" class=

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While we
              cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
              have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no
              prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors
              in such states who approach us with offers to donate.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
              International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot
              make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations
              received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp
              our small staff.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Please check
              the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods

              Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
